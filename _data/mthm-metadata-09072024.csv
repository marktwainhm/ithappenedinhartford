This first station was designed to reflect an Italianate country villa, with arches, towers, and columns. The design was reflective of the opulence of the era and physical manifestation of Hartford�s claim to an elite status. The tracks ran through the center of the building and serviced two lines. Unfortunately, Union Depot was designed with style over substance and soon became too crowded and could not keep up with the demand of the bustling city. 
The second station is the building you still see here today. Hartford�s Union Station opened to the public in 1889 and was designed with function in mind to better serve the growing city. The tracks were moved to a second story level so that they didn�t interfere with the carriage traffic on the streets below. The new station also increased the number of lines being served from two to four, giving the residents of Hartford greater access to locales all over the country. ",

The company was to be a subscription-based publishing house, which meant that it sold books from door to door using salesmen. They would put together what was called a “salesmen’s prospectus” which was a thin, condensed version of the actual book with sample chapters, illustrations, and bindings. After the salesmen presented a customer with the prospectus and made their pitch, they could read a chapter or two, ponder over the drawings, and ultimately decide if they wanted to place an order for it. If so, they were able to choose which binding and cover they wanted which ranged in price. This method of sales allowed publishing companies to reach more people who did not necessarily have a bookstore nearby to peruse and purchase from. ",

","The Mark Twain House and Museum, Gift of Mrs. Joseph Roehl, 1976","One of the perks of being a lady�s maid was that you were often given cast off clothing from the mistress of the house. This was true in the Clemens household as well: Olivia Clemens gave this nightgown to her lady�s maid, Katy Leary. Leary later gave the nightgown to Mr. and Mrs. Edward Ryan, owners of a farm on Albany Avenue in Hartford, CT, where she often went to purchase chickens and eggs for the Clemenses� meals.",

Dear Sir: 
I shall be here at home some three weeks yet, & possibly longer. I cannot therefore tell exactly when I shall be in New York. But I stop at the St. Nicholas Hotel always, & if you should glance at the hotel arrivals in The Tribune you would see when I come & then I would be glad if you dropped in.

Tintypes were often used for portraits between 1853 when it was introduced by Adolphe Alexandre Martine) and the mid-1860s. This black and white portrait was mostly likely taken in a photographers studio. It depicts an African-American worman standing on a rug, next to a chair and with windows behind her to the proper left. The woman is wearing a black, long-sleeved, mid-thigh legnth top and a white floor-legthen skirt. Her right hand is resting on the back/top of the tuffeted arm chair. The chair has wooden arms and lefts but the seat, back, and arms are covered in what appears to be velvet-like fabric. The woman's top has a collar and buttons down the front. The woman's hiar is platted and tied up on the back of her head; a part just left of center is prominate. The woman's body is posed at a slight angle to the camera with her left shoulder and arm closer to the camera; however, the woman's head is turned to peer directly at the camera/viewer. She has a slight smile on her face. There may be something in the woman's left hand but what it is in unidefiable. The photograph has a white boarder with no text written to identify the subject or photographer. The woman has been identified as Mary Ann Cord.

Clemens heard her life story while staying in Elmira in the summer of 1874. Publishing it in the Atlantic Monthly the same year, he titled it “A True Story: Repeated Word for Word as I Heard It.” He changed her name to “Aunt Rachel.”
 
Cord’s son Henry, a barber in Elmira, brought her to the city, where she married Primus Cord and lived out her life working “in service” with several families. She died at age 80 in 1888 and is buried in the same cemetery as the Clemens and Langdon families.",

Pond was �packed with a waiting audience and Standing Room Only signs.� The Oregonian reviewed Clemens� lecture, stating: �At its close the lecturer took occasion to thank his hearers for such a cordial reception on a summer evening, and expressed his sincere gratification that his meeting with the public of Portland was of such a substantial and pleasing character.�
Clemens left the city the next day. Oregonian reporter Lute Pease met Twain outside the Hotel Portland and rode with him to the train station. �As they rode down Sixth street he told Pease: �Portland seems to be a pretty nice town and this is a pretty nice smooth street. Now Portland ought to lay itself out a little and macadamize (pave) all the streets like this. Then it ought to own all the bicycles and rent �em out and so pay for the streets. Pretty good scheme, eh?� As Clemens left, he said, �Well, I haven�t had an opportunity to see much of Portland � I am compelled to leave it after but a glimpse. I may never see Portland again, but I liked the glimpse.�

","The Mark Twain Papers, Bancroft Library, University of California at Berkeley","During his boyhood summers in the 1840s Clemens spent time at his uncle’s 250-acre farm outside Hannibal, Missouri. He listened to stories from Daniel Quarles, an enslaved man. “He has served me well these many, many years,” Clemens wrote late in life “I have not seen him for more than half a century and yet spiritually I have had his welcome company a good part of that time and have staged him in books under his own name and as ‘Jim.’

Scholars agree that Clemens owed more than the character of Jim in Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884) to Quarles and other African Americans. Ralph Ellison wrote in 1970 of the book’s prose: “Without the presence of blacks, the book could not have been written. No Huck and Jim, no American novel as we know it. For not only is the black man a co-creator of the language that Mark Twain raised to the level of literary eloquence, but Jim’s condition as an American and Huck’s commitment to freedom are at the moral center of the novel.” This photograph shows Mary Quarles, daughter of Daniel Quarles, and was taken by Albert Bigelow Paine for a 1911 Harper's Magazine story. On the back of the image Paine wrote: ""This woman was a littler colored girl who looked after Samuel Clemens at his faimly farm.""",
