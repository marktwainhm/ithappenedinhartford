The company was to be a subscription-based publishing house, which meant that it sold books from door to door using salesmen. They would put together what was called a “salesmen’s prospectus” which was a thin, condensed version of the actual book with sample chapters, illustrations, and bindings. After the salesmen presented a customer with the prospectus and made their pitch, they could read a chapter or two, ponder over the drawings, and ultimately decide if they wanted to place an order for it. If so, they were able to choose which binding and cover they wanted which ranged in price. This method of sales allowed publishing companies to reach more people who did not necessarily have a bookstore nearby to peruse and purchase from. "

The company was to be a subscription-based publishing house, which meant that it sold books from door to door using salesmen. They would put together what was called a “salesmen’s prospectus” which was a thin, condensed version of the actual book with sample chapters, illustrations, and bindings. After the salesmen presented a customer with the prospectus and made their pitch, they could read a chapter or two, ponder over the drawings, and ultimately decide if they wanted to place an order for it. If so, they were able to choose which binding and cover they wanted which ranged in price. This method of sales allowed publishing companies to reach more people who did not necessarily have a bookstore nearby to peruse and purchase from. "

Clemens) and Charles Dudley Warner was published by the Hartford-based firm American Publishing Company owned by Elisha Bliss. The company was to be a subscription-based publishing house, which meant that it sold books from door to door using salesmen. They would put together what was called a “salesmen’s prospectus” which was a thin, condensed version of the actual book with sample chapters, illustrations, and bindings. After the salesmen presented a customer with the prospectus and made their pitch, they could read a chapter or two, ponder over the drawings, and ultimately decide if they wanted to place an order for it. If so, they were able to choose which binding and cover they wanted which ranged in price.

Tintypes were often used for portraits between 1853 when it was introduced by Adolphe Alexandre Martine) and the mid-1860s. This black and white portrait was mostly likely taken in a photographers studio. It depicts an African-American worman standing on a rug, next to a chair and with windows behind her to the proper left. The woman is wearing a black, long-sleeved, mid-thigh legnth top and a white floor-legthen skirt. Her right hand is resting on the back/top of the tuffeted arm chair. The chair has wooden arms and lefts but the seat, back, and arms are covered in what appears to be velvet-like fabric. The woman's top has a collar and buttons down the front. The woman's hiar is platted and tied up on the back of her head; a part just left of center is prominate. The woman's body is posed at a slight angle to the camera with her left shoulder and arm closer to the camera; however, the woman's head is turned to peer directly at the camera/viewer. She has a slight smile on her face. There may be something in the woman's left hand but what it is in unidefiable. The photograph has a white boarder with no text written to identify the subject or photographer. The woman has been identified as Mary Ann Cord.

Publishing it in the Atlantic Monthly the same year, he titled it “A True Story: Repeated Word for Word as I Heard It.” He changed her name to “Aunt Rachel.”
 
Cord’s son Henry, a barber in Elmira, brought her to the city, where she married Primus Cord and lived out her life working “in service” with several families. She died at age 80 in 1888 and is buried in the same cemetery as the Clemens and Langdon families."

The book was being published by the American Publishing Company here in Hartford. The letter seen here to Charles F. Windgate is written from Hartford and shows the balancing act Clemens maintained between traveling and staying in Hartford to write. 
Dear Sir: 
I shall be here at home some three weeks yet, & possibly longer. I cannot therefore tell exactly when I shall be in New York. But I stop at the St. Nicholas Hotel always, & if you should glance at the hotel arrivals in The Tribune you would see when I come & then I would be glad if you dropped in. The reason I cannot be more positive as to the day I shall leave here is that I am finishing a book & I find it impossible to tell exactly when I am going to get it done. 
Very truly Yours,
 Samuel L. Clemens  "

",,"The Mark Twain Papers, Bancroft Library, University of California at Berkeley","During his boyhood summers in the 1840s Clemens spent time at his uncle’s 250-acre farm outside Hannibal, Missouri. He listened to stories from Daniel Quarles, an enslaved man. “He has served me well these many, many years,” Clemens wrote late in life “I have not seen him for more than half a century and yet spiritually I have had his welcome company a good part of that time and have staged him in books under his own name and as ‘Jim.’

Scholars agree that Clemens owed more than the character of Jim in Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884) to Quarles and other African Americans. Ralph Ellison wrote in 1970 of the book’s prose: “Without the presence of blacks, the book could not have been written. No Huck and Jim, no American novel as we know it. For not only is the black man a co-creator of the language that Mark Twain raised to the level of literary eloquence, but Jim’s condition as an American and Huck’s commitment to freedom are at the moral center of the novel.” This photograph shows Mary Quarles, daughter of Daniel Quarles, and was taken by Albert Bigelow Paine for a 1911 Harper's Magazine story. On the back of the image Paine wrote: ""This woman was a littler colored girl who looked after Samuel Clemens at his faimly farm."""

The telegram was sent using the American Union Telegraph Company as indicated by their logo at the top of the page. The telegram was sent from Samuel L. Clemens (Mark Twain) from Elmira, New York where the family often stayed with Clemens' in-laws, to George Griffin, the family's Hartford-based butler. The telegram is dated September 11, 1880 and instructs George to collect $20 from Charles Perkins, Clemens' friend, lawyer, and business agent. On the back of the page, George writes in pencil: ""Rec'd  indiscernible twenty \ dollars - Sept 13, 1880 \ George Griffin""

Transcription:
