September 2024 marks the 150th anniversary of the arrival of the Clemens family in their newly built Hartford home and 50 years since the Mark Twain House formally opened as a Museum. We are celebrating these important milestones over the next year in a number of ways, including a special exhibition, a community history project, and an education initiative.
