September 2024 marks the 150th anniversary of the arrival of the Clemens family in their newly built Hartford home and 50 years since the Mark Twain House was formally opened as a Museum. We are celebrating these important milestones over the next year in a number of ways, including:
It Happened in Hartford: 150 years of the Mark Twain House: a multi-layered exhibition experience that takes you from our historic house through the streets of Hartford exploring both through the lens of Samuel Clemens’ career. 

Your Twain Story: the chance for our community at large to share how this house, in its many uses from a single family dwelling, to a school, to a group of apartments, to a library branch before opening as a historic house museum, has impacted your life. We want to hear your memories, capture them for our institutional archive and create a community of mutual pride for this place. 

[It Happened In Your Town]({{ '/getinvolved.html' | relative_url }}): an education initiative, students around the state are encouraged to partner with their local historical societies, museums, and libraries to find out what was happening in their town in 1874, allowing students to engage with their community’s past and present, demonstrating the power of local history to tell national and global stories. 

If those markers aren’t enough, you can [download the ACTIONBOUND app]({{ '/actionbound-history-hunts.html' | relative_url }}) and take one of our scavenger hunts to explore Hartford through the lens of the Clemens’ family and the people who worked in this house in/around 1874, the year the house was built.
