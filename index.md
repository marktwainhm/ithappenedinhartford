We're celebrating the 150th birthday of The Mark Twain House with our city-wide digital exhibit “It Happened In Hartford.”

Located in the Nook Farm neighborhood of Hartford, Connecticut, The Mark Twain House & Museum celebrates the life and legacy of Samuel L. Clemens as one of our nation’s defining cultural figures. The Museum serves the public by preserving the historic Mark Twain House, and by offering numerous educational and cultural programs for students, teachers, and the public. The Museum's collection contains approximately 20,000 items, with our most important object being the historic home of author Mark Twain, which has been meticulously restored over a period of many years and is designated a National Historic Landmark. In addition to the house, the Museum's collection can be broken up into four major categories: Objects & Artifacts, Archives, Special Collections, and our Research Library. Our goal is to make the documents and artifacts in our collections accessible to researchers and the general public.
