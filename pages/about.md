## About the Site

Founded in 1929 and operating as a public museum since 1974, the collection of approximately 16,000 artifacts at the Mark Twain House & Museum celebrates the life and legacy of Samuel L. Clemens as one of our nation’s defining cultural figures. 
The mission of the Mark Twain House is: “From this house, Mark Twain changed the way the world sees America and the way Americans see themselves. We carry on his legacy.” Our Vision Statement is: “We preserve Mark Twain’s house and works to inspire the world. We allow everyone to experience what Mark Twain called “the loveliest home that ever was” and the stories of the Samuel Clemens family. We inspire other writers. We are a writer’s home -- and a home for writers. We encourage critical thinking and foster literacy, humanity, humor, satire and social justice. We are a forum for exploring and discussing issues of the day, mirroring Twain’s own passions.”
In addition to interpreting the historic Hartford house, the museum presents a wide variety of programs and exhibitions that serve diverse audiences and that celebrate the literary, visual, and performing arts. The Mark Twain Houseis a place to learn about history and to connect to the world of the literary arts by virtue of our mission--to carry on the legacy of author and performer, Mark Twain.
