Joel Chandler Harris began his working life as a printer and journalist. After working for papers throughout Georgia, in 1876 he joined the staff of the Atlanta _Constitution_, which published his first “Uncle Remus” stories. “Uncle Remus” was a fictional character that narrated stories.These reworkings of African-American folktales, distinguished for their dialect, became very well known. Clemens was a fan of Harris’s work and often read his stories to his daughters. Occasionally he would select pieces for his public readings.  He complimented him by calling him, “the only master the country has produced.” In 1882 Clemens inquired about whether Harris would be interested in joining him and George Washington Cable on a lecture tour. Initially Harris considered the offer and the money it could provide. However, when he met with the two men, they discovered how timid he was. Clemens remarked that he was the “bashfulest grown person” he had ever encountered. Despite this, Clemens and Harris remained good friends. Harris paid a visit to the Hartford house in 1882 and corresponded with Clemens steadily over the next several years. Harris died in 1908, two years before Clemens.
