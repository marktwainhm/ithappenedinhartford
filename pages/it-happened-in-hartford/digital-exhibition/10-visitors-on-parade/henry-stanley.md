Sir Henry Morton Stanley, born in 1841, had a long and fulfilling life spending his time as an explorer, writer, soldier, and politician. He is most well known for exploring Africa in search of a missionary and explorer, when he located him, he uttered the famous line, “Dr. Livingstone I presume?” Aside from his discovery of Dr. Livingstone, Stanley spent time searching for the sources of the Nile and Congo rivers, under the auspices of King Leopold II of Belgium. He wrote several books over his lifetime regaling audiences with his tales of adventure and danger including _In Darkest Africa_. Clemens put in heavy efforts to get Stanley to publish with his firm, Charles Webster & Co., unfortunately, he was never able to land a deal. The Clemens family did host Stanley at the Hartford house before leaving for Boston to make a speech, where Clemens would make introductory remarks. Stanley spoke at Unity Hall while in Hartford but was introduced by Rev. Dr. Parker, not Clemens.  He wrote to Stanley and enticed him with the promise of “…silence, & rest, & beer, for the weary; & whisky & billiards for those that are so disposed. Come – say yes.” (do we want to talk about controversy of Stanley or is that unnecessary?)
