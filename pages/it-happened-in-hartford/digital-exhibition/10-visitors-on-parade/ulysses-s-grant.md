Ulysses S. Grant rose through the ranks quickly during the Civil War before ultimately being appointed general-in-chief of all the Union armies by President Abaham Lincoln. Subsequently he was elected to the United States presidency and served two terms from 1869-1877.In his post-presidency years invested in a brokerage firm run by a friend of his sons. The firm was run as a Ponzi scheme and eventually it collapsed, leaving him penniless. To make matters worse, Grant soon after learned he had throat cancer and a short time to live. In order to provide for his family after his death, Grant decided to take an offer from Century Magazine to write four articles about his time during the Civil War with the potential of penning his memoirs. Clemens hears of the proposed deal which he found lackluster. He countered with his own offer and tried to convince Grant to sign with his publishing firm, Charles L. Webster & Co. His terms were extremely generous, and Grant decided to sign with him instead. Grant died only a few days after he finished his memoirs. They were published posthumously, and the money provided helped set his family up for the remainder of their lives. Clemens presented Grant’s widow Julia, with the largest royalty check ever made up until that point ($200,000). Altogether they made over $400,000. The memoirs are still highly regarded and widely read today. Clemens extolled Grant as “a very great man—& superlatively good.”
