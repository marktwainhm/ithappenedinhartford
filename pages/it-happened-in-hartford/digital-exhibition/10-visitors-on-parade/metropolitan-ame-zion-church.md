In 1816 African American Christians in Hartford got tired of being segregated in the balconies of churches dominated by Whites, and began to hold Sunday meetings on their own. Ten years later they formed an African Religious Society with its own building on Talcott Street. The society split in 1833, with one faction forming a Congregational church and the other a Methodist Episcopal church.

The Methodist group affiliated with the national African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church founded in New York, also as a reaction to segregation and bias. (This is a denomination separate from the African Methodist Episcopal Church, founded in Philadelphia, though today they share communion.) Blacks had been active in the American Methodist church since its beginnings in the 18th century, with a Black missionary named Harry Hosier aiding Francis Asbury, the White Englishman credited with spreading Methodism in the United States. The specifics of the faith appealed to African Americans as well, particularly a stress on the equality of sinners before God and the church’s strong anti-slavery stance. Among the prominent figures who were members of A.M.E. Zion congregations were Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, and Sojourner Truth.

In the 1850s Hartford’s AME Zion Church was required to move from its site on Talcott Street when the land became part of the new city park, Bushnell Park. The congregation built a new church on Pearl Street. By the time Samuel and Olivia Clemens moved to the city in 1871 the African American community had grown to about 1,000 people in a total city population of about 38,000. The Clemenses’ African American butler, George Griffin, was a “strenuously religious” deacon in the Pearl Street church, Samuel Clemens wrote. In this role he often interceded on behalf of members of the Black community who “sought his advice in their troubles, and he kept many a case of theirs out of the court by settling it himself.” In March 1881 Clemens spoke at the church, joined by the choir.

In 1926 the church moved to a former Methodist church built in 1873-74 – the same years that the Clemenses were building their house. Like the Clemens home, it’s an example of the High Victorian Gothic style, with medieval-style features such as arched windows, buttresses and ceiling beams, along with decorative polychromatic masonry. The original Methodist congregation sold the building to a Jewish congregation, and it had served as a synagogue for eight years before Metropolitan AME Zion Church (as it is now known) purchased the building.
