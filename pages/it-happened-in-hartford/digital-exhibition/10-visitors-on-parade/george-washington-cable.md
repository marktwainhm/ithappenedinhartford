A southern writer and former Confederate soldier from New Orleans, George Washington Cable struggled as a young teenager to try to support his family while simultaneously trying to educate himself. In the 1870s, he focused on being a writer of stories about Creole life, which brought him recognition and fame. Clemens first encountered Cable in Hartford in June of 1881, and it started a long and fruitful friendship. They met again the following year in New Orleans and decided to put together a lecture tour. From November 1884 through February 1885, Cable and Clemens traveled with one another on their joint lecture tour, which visited more than sixty cities in the United States and Canada. Following the conclusion of the tour Cable decided to pull up his southern roots. According to the Mark Twain Papers & Project, “As an outspoken critic of aspects of southern culture and an advocate of the rights of black Americans, Cable found it difficult to remain in the South, moving to Northampton, Massachusetts, in 1885. Samuel was irritated by what he considered Cable’s excessive piety, his parsimony, and also by his more mundane offenses such as hogging the lectern, but the two remained friendly. In Mark Twain’s book, _Life on the Mississippi_ he referred to Cable as, “The south’s finest literary genius.”
