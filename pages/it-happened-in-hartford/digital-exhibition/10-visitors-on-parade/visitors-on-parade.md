The Clemens family home was built with three guestrooms. The first floor Mahogany suite made up of a large bedroom, a dressing room, and bathroom attached was meant for prominent guests. Authors Grace King, Bret Harte, and George Washington Cable are among those that stayed there. Over the seventeen years the family lived in the house they welcomed other prominent guests such as Sir Henry Stanley, P.T. Barnum, Generals Sheridan and Sherman, and Edwin Booth, however there is no evidence that they stayed overnight. The second-floor guestroom was meant for family and often it was Olivia’s widowed mother who would occupy it. It had been designed specifically as a place for her to spend several months a year with the family.  The final guestroom was located on the third floor and was referred to as “The Artist’s Friend’s Room” which may have derived its name from Samuel Clemens’s mischievous delight in portraying himself as an artist. This was a place for a male guest to retire after a late night of drinking and billiards. The exception was in 1887 when it housed Aoki Koto House, the adopted daughter of Clemens’s journalist friend and later enemy – Edward H. House. When the Bissell family lived in the house, they hosted President Theodore Roosevelt for dinner.
