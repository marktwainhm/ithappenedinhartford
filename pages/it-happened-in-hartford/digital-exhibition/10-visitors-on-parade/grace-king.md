Grace King was a southern writer from New Orleans who focused on stories, events, and the  history of her home state of Louisiana. Born in 1851 to a well-known and respected family who lost most of their money and property during the Civil War, Grace focused on her formal education. She was an avid reader and during the 1885 Cotton Centennial Exposition she met the editor Richard Watson Gilder and they had discussions about George W. Cable (link) why King herself did not attempt to write her own stories of Louisiana. The next day she put pen to paper and wrote her first published short story. With assistance from good friend and fellow author, Charles Dudley Warner (link) she focused on writing and made it her goal to become financially independent. Through Warner she met Samuel Clemens (link to her first impression of him) in June of 1887 and she quickly became friends with the entire Clemens family. They all became frequent correspondents with her over the years. Olivia enjoyed discussing books and authors with King and the pair often made suggestions to one another about what to read next. The Clemens' daughters adored her and often wrote asking when her next visit to Hartford to stay with them was (link to her description of staying in Mahogany suite). Towards the end of her life King was revered for her literary talent and deep knowledge of southern history. She spent her last several years bedridden and died in January of 1932. She finished her autobiography, Memories of a Southern Woman of letters shortly before she passed away.
