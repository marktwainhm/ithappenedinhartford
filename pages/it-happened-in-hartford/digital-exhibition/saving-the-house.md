Saving the House 
=================

The prime mover in the rescue of the Mark Twain House was Katherine Seymour Day, grandniece of Harriet Beecher Stowe, who in 1925 envisioned a literary center based in this neighborhood. She challenged the area’s increasing commercialization and formed a group called the Friends of Hartford to lobby the city government – “the local Tammany,” she called it, referring to New York’s notorious political club. A campaign was set up to raise money to buy the house, and the final price tag was $150,000, with a mortgage of $55,000. 

Clara Clemens Gabrilowitsch, Samuel Clemens’s sole surviving daughter, lent her acting talents to the cause in a stage production of her father’s Joan of Arc to raise money for the purchase and refurbishing of the house. Day and the Friends were victorious: on April 29, 1929, the General Assembly of the State of Connecticut issued a charter to the Mark Twain Memorial and Library Commission. Apartments remained on the upper floors, and the ground floor became the Mark Twain Branch of the Hartford Public Library for the next 26 years. 

The women of the newly created Mark Twain Committee of the Friends of Hartford quickly moved into the first floor with examples of period furniture, old paintings and engravings, books by Mark Twain, and other memorabilia. The city library’s Mark Twain Branch opened on April 25, 1930, with a buffet and reception attended by Clemens’s surviving daughter, Clara, and her husband, Ossip Gabrilowitsch. She was a singer and he a pianist, and the evening before they had given a joint recital at the Horace Bushnell Memorial Hall to benefit the restoration of her childhood home. 

The house had suffered hard use during its years as a school and apartment building. Every meeting of the Memorial’s trustees brought new reports of repairs needed. The electric wiring was deemed a menace, the roof and heating system needed repairs, the plumbing was bad, and a new boiler was needed. Mice, bats, and pigeons had taken up residence. The income from the rent paid by tenants and the library were not enough to keep the house in shape, let alone begin restoration. 

### GRID - Kathrine Seymore Day 

Katharine Seymour Day had impeccable Nook Farm lineage and was born to Olivia’s good friend, Alice Hooker Day and her husband John Day. The Clemenses attended their wedding in 1869 and the newlyweds welcomed their daughter a year later. (The couple later rented the Clemens home while Samuel and Olivia were in Europe in the 1890s.) Katharine was the granddaughter of John and Isabella Beecher Hooker, and the great-niece of Harriet Beecher Stowe (link). Katharine lived her life in a perpetual state of education, studying painting in Paris and New York, and in her forties studying psychology, philosophy and anthropology at Radcliffe, Columbia, and Berkeley.  She spent time living throughout Europe studying painting and displayed her art in Paris. She moved briefly to New York City in 1896 to study under William Merritt Chase. However, her attention was eventually pulled back to her roots. She told her neighbors of her vision for a literary center in Hartford based on the two famous writer’s houses so close to each other – and wrote to her mother her plan for the Stowe House and her concern over the Clemens home. In 1924 she purchased and moved into her former great aunt’s home in Nook Farm which became the Harriet Beecher Stowe Center in 1968. In Hartford she pitched into Farmington Ave. zoning battles, challenged the increasing commercialization of the neighborhood, and formed a group called the Friends of Hartford to help lobby the city government. A campaign was set up to raise the money to purchase the Clemens home and refurbish it. Her dedication to preservation in Hartford led to saving several important structures including the Stowe and Clemens homes. She died in June of 1864 at 94 years of age. She was inducted into the Connecticut Women’s Hall of Fame in 1994.

The Library Moves In
--------------------

Soon after the Mark Twain Memorial Commission took over the ownership of the Mark Twain House, a talk of a partnership with the Hartford Public Library began and it is suggested that this partnership helped the Mark Twain Memorial Commission, and thus the house as it stands today, survive. A December 6, 1928 letter to the editor of the Hartford Courant suggests that that Mark Twain Memorial campaign has not been successful is due to “a considerable percentage of the persons who might contribute neither particularly liked Mr. Clemens nor approved certain of his books. Moreover, as he was neither a native of Hartford nor, after living there for some time, cared to make it his permanent residence, many consider the proposed memorial, as such, not incumbent upon the city…. On the other hand, everyone, as far as I know, thinks a branch library upon the site in question to be very desirable and that I should contain articles associated with Hartford’s many writers of the past, and in due time, of those who we hope, will succeed them.”

 The Mark Twain Library Branch idea took off and was seeded by a donation of 500 books by Mrs. Arthur G Sugden (worth $1,000 in 1928) to start the Mark Twain Library branch collection. After three years, the branch finally came to life, opening to the public on May 1, 1930.

The library took over most of the first floor of the house, including the front hall, drawing room, dining room, and library, for use by library patrons and other spaces for offices and storage. A newspaper article from 1930 shortly after the public opening, stated that the drawing room had become the “children’s room of the branch library. It has been… filled with books well intended to delight the heart of any child.”

 On Friday, April 25, 1930, four days before the public opening, the Mark Twain Library and Memorial Commission and the Hartford Public Library Board of Trustees hosted a small private reception in honor of the Branch’s opening. In attendance at this reception was Clara Clemens Gabrilowitsch, only living child of Samuel Clemens/Mark Twain, along with her husband Ossip Gabrilowitsch.

During the visit, Clara was overcome by emotion visiting the house she and her family once lived in, seeing all of the changes that time did to the house, and work and hope being done to restore it back to the grandeur it once was. She was quoted in a Hartford Courant article saying, “My father made this house an unusual receptacle to received the good that God can give and I am glad that this library will make the same sort of place for the present generation.”

 At that same event, Truman R. Temple, Hartford’s City Librarian, said “You have seen your labors crowned with success but you are no happier than I am.  Have been looking for this day for three years. It is a delightful place to carry on a branch library. For the first time, we will be able to carry on our work in pleasant surroundings. We will carry on our work here with the inspiration of Mark Twain's spirit, the author who could see a little more than any other into the hearts of children.”

 The Mark Twain Library Branch within the Mark Twain House opened on May 1, 1930 with the hours of every afternoon from 1-6pm and Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evenings from 7-9pm The first branch library was Miss Lillian Abele , who was followed by five other branch librarians: Esther K. Dudly (1932), Ruth Hyatt (1933-1914), Anita L. Woodward (1935-1937), Desier C. Moulton (1938-1945), and Esther D. Rioux (1946-1956).

The Mark Twain Library Branch moved locations, just down the street, at the end April 1956; reopening in their new home on May 1, 1956. The Hartford Courant reported that in the Branch’s 27 years at the Mark Twain House, it served 775,000 readers and at its close held 10,000 books, journals, periodicals and magazines which were transferred to the new location.

Today the Mark Twain Branch of the Hartford Public Library is still an active branch of the library system and located at 927 Asylum Ave, Hartford, CT 06105 and open \[hours tbd as their website isn’t loading for me\].

Museum Era
----------

Formal restoration of the house began in 1963, the same year the Mark Twain House was designated a National Historic Landmark.

The work began with the Billiards Room. Research, physical investigation, and restoration of the rest of the house continued, and all the major rooms of the home were opened in time for the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the house in 1974.

In 1999, the museum began a capital campaign that led to the opening of the museum center in 2003, by which time the organization had been renamed The Mark Twain House & Museum.  The new structure, strategically located and nestled in a hillside not to detract from the Mark Twain House, was designed by Robert A. M. Stern as the first LEED-certified “green” museum in the United States.

The following years included a significant interior restoration in 2004-2005, including the restoration of the Kitchen and Servants’ Wing.

The 2010 Centennial of Mark Twain’s death was an occasion for a revival of activities in the house and museum. During that summer, as average museum attendance declined in the region, attendance at the Mark Twain House & Museum reached record levels.

### GRID - Walter K. Schwinn

Walter K. Schwinn was born in 1901 in Red Oak, Iowa. He graduated from University of Wisconsin and Harvard University respectively before working as a staff reporter for the Manchester, New Hampshire, Union. That was quickly followed up with a stint at the Springfield Union as an editorial writer, before arriving in Hartford in 1929 to become the chief editorial writer and associate editor until 1943. Schwinn was tremendously active in the city and supported the Hartford School of Music, the Travelers Aid Society, and the Tuberculosis and Public Health Society, among others. After serving in WW2, he was awarded the Medal of Freedom. He ultimately retired from foreign service in 1961 except for a brief recall in 1965 to direct an exhibition of graphic arts in Poland sponsored by the U.S. government. As he settled into retirement in Hartford he became a member of the board for the Hartford Art School, and a regent of the University of Hartford. He served as President for five years of the Mark Twain Memorial and authored an unpublished history of the house. (photo of Schwinn with HH) 

### GRID - Edith Colgate Salsbury

In the 1950s, a new generation took on the rigorous job of restoring the Mark Twain House to its appearance in the Clemenses’ time. Notable among these was Edith Colgate Salsbury. Born in Bedford, New York, she was an artist, and her first love was painting. She spent time studying at the Ecole Americaine des Beaux Arts in France where she eventually met her future husband Charles Baker Salsbury. After graduating from Smith College, she decided to refocus her attention to the field of history and when her family relocated to Hartford she soon became involved in the Mark Twain Memorial. She appeared at the house almost daily, performing nearly every task that needed to be done: drafting plans, raising funds, devising publicity, conducting research, and even whitewashing walls and sweeping floors. In 1965 Salsbury published an engaging account of life in the Clemens household taken from the actual words of family members and others titled, Susy and Mark Twain. She was made a trustee and vice president of the Mark Twain Memorial as well as the Chairman of the Research Committee. In addition to all her work dedicated to the legacy of the Clemens family, Salsbury was also a member of the National Arts Club, the National Society of Women Painters and Sculptors, and the Cosmopolitan Club.  

### GRID - Friends of The Mark Twain House & Museum

Fran Gordon met with 32 women on September 25, 1967 to formally organize what is now the Friends of the Mark Twain House & Museum.\* The group evolved after the president of the Board of Trustees added women to its membership in 1954. They were responsible for caring for museum collections, library cataloging and research, and giving tours of the house.

The Friends began fundraising in 1954 when they assisted with the celebration of Twain’s birthday with the reading of his works by Governor Lodge. As their numbers grew, so did the events they developed and sponsored. The yearly financial contribution to the Mark Twain House began with a donation of $1,366 in 1970 after a fashion show. In 1975 member trips to locations Mark Twain wrote about became another source of revenue, and by 1976 the group’s contributions exceeded $19,000.

The annual Holiday House Tour began in 1979 and continues to be an annual fundraising event. Private homes, the Mark Twain House, and sometimes public buildings are included in the tour.

In 1995 Kay Hoffman and Marty Flanders organized an event that for many years functioned as a gala fundraiser for the Museum. It raised $40,000 that year. From 1999 through 2002 the Galas continued to raise over $100,000 annually for the operating expenses of the Mark Twain House.

When the Visitors and Education Center for the Mark Twain Housewas announced, the Friends contributed $30,000 to the capital campaign fund. It is astonishing to realize that since 1967 the Friends, in their fundraising efforts with the Holiday Galas and Holiday House Tours, have contributed more than $1,000,000 to the operating funds of The Mark Twain House.

While fundraising for The Mark Twain House & Museum is our mission, we enjoy all aspects of doing this with the creative and talented members we have had over many years of service to The Mark Twain House & Museum.

1974 Museum Opening 
--------------------

After 45 years of fundraising, 19 years of restoration, and 100 years after its initial construction, the Mark Twain Memorial opened its doors as a museum in September 1974. At that time you entered through the basement of the house where the gift shop and ticket desk were located. The kitchen wing was staff offices, and a number of the unrestored rooms were used as collections storage. In 1974, Wilson Faude was the curator of the museum and oversaw years of research, tedious re-stenciling, and the acquisition of objects and furniture belonging to the Clemens family. In an article about the opening celebrations, Faude is quoted as saying, “about 14 percent of the furnishings belonged to Twain and the family. The rest was donated by citizens after rigid documentation for historical validity.”

2003 Visitor center Opening
---------------------------

By the early-2000s the Mark Twain House’s staff, visitation, and collection had outgrown the two historic buildings (the house itself and the adjacent carriage house). Thus the institution hired architect Robert A.M. Sterns to design and build a museum center. The resulting 35,000-square-foot building was built into the hillside so it wouldn’t overshadow the historic structures, but would provide space for administrative use, retail, education, exhibitions, and collections storage. Then Executive Director John Boyer is quoted as saying “He \[Twain\] is constantly and continually percolating through popular culture. He’s out there. He is being read in the classrooms. He is still being converted into films and television projects and all of that kind of stuff. There are more and more kid’s versions of Twain’s stories. It’s remarkable; there really is a growth market for this legacy”

Mark Twain House Today
----------------------

Today The Mark Twain House & Museum celebrates the life and legacy of Samuel L. Clemens as one of our nation’s defining cultural figures. The Museum serves the public by preserving the historic Mark Twain House, and by offering numerous educational and cultural programs for students, teachers, and the public. The Museum's collection contains approximately 20,000 items, with our most important object being the historic home of author Mark Twain, which has been meticulously restored over a period of many years and is designated a National Historic Landmark.
