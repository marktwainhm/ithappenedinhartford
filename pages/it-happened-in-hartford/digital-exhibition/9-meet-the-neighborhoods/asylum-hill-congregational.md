As the city of Hartford developed as a manufacturing, insurance, and shipping port in the mid-19th century, many of the wealthier residents built homes on its western fringe, previously a scene of fields, meadows, ponds, and the city’s poorhouse. Downtown churches now seemed too far for convenient Sunday morning travel, and pious Congregationalists had run a Sunday school there for several years before the church building was built in 1865.

The architect, Patrick Keely, designed a spired stone church much more in the English parish church tradition than the simple wooden meeting-house style previously used by Congregationalist congregations. Its upper-crust Protestant reputation was such that Samuel Clemens, on a business trip to the city in 1868, called it “The Church of the Holy Speculators.” When they arrived to live in the city in 1871, he and Olivia became regular attendees of the church, worshipping at a downtown church that had better music program only when their close friend, Rev. Joseph Twichell, was away. Samuel took part in church social functions, including a much-publicized spelling bee, and often accompanied Twichell to speaking engagements on behalf of the church at hospitals and missions for the poor.
