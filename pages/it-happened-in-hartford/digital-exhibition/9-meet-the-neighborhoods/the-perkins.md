### Thomas Clap Perkins (1798-1870) & Mary Beecher Perkins (1805-1900)  
Lawyer Thomas Clap Perkins married teacher Mary Beecher in 1827. The couple had four children, and one of their granddaughters was author Charlotte Perkins Gilman. Mary, known as the "quiet" Beecher sister, was not a public activist like her siblings. Her letters, though, reveal a witty, articulate observer of her times. The Perkins were among the first residents of Nook Farm; and when they built their new house in 1866, it was on nearby Woodland Street. This home was built for Thomas Clap and Mary Beecher Perkins (Stowe's sister) -- and occupied by them from 1855 to 1866 -- on the south side of Hawthorn Street, across from the home of Mary's sister Isabella Beecher Hooker. The architect was Octavius Jordon. Charles Dudley and Susan Warner lived here from 1866-1884. As the family home of Dr. Thomas and feminist Katharine Houghton Hepburn from 1908 to 1917, it was the childhood home of actor Katharine Hepburn.
