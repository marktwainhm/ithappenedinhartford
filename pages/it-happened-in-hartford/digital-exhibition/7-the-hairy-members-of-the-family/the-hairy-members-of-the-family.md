During the 17 years the Clemens family spent here at their home in Hartford, they had a wide variety of animal friends: cats, dogs, horses, cows, birds--even squirrels! And it wasn’t just Susy, Clara, and Jean that loved animals--their father Samuel Clemens had been an animal lover his whole life!

Though humans and animals have a long history together, keeping animals as pets is a fairly recent development. For thousands of years, people had dogs for hunting and cats to keep the mice away, but it was only in the 19th century--the time when the Clemens family lived--that it started to be common for people to keep animals as friends and companions.

One pet we know the family had while they lived here was a very large dog named Flash. We can tell how big he is because we have pictures of him with the girls on the House’s front porch. We also know that another dog lived on property, probably over in the carriage house with Patrick McAleer and his family, because in May 1880, Samuel paid $2.15 to the  Hartford Town Clerk for a dog license, marking it down in his account books as “Dog license for Jip the coach dog.” 

The Clemens family had lots of dogs, but they had even more cats! When Samuel was a child, cats were the only animal his mother would allow in the house. At one point, he remembered having nineteen of them! When he was an adult, with a family of his own and much more money, Clemens had a house full of cats wherever he went. He liked to give them very silly names, like Buffalo Bill, Satan, Sin, Sourmash, and Bambino.  

When he was away, Samuel loved receiving letters from his children letting him know how things were at home, including updates on the animals: “I enjoy your letters ever so much, & am exceedingly thankful to get them, for I like to hear all about Flash & the cats & all the rest of the family.” 

The Clemens girls loved having pets so much that they often wanted more than cats and dogs. Once, Susy and Clara tried to tame some squirrels as pets, hiding them in a closet in the house. They had to give up on that project when their father discovered the squirrels, who had chewed up the inside of the closet.  Clara also tried to ride her pet cow Jumbo--but Jumbo didn’t like that very much.

Pets weren’t the only animals the Clemenses had here. Their coachman Patrick McAleer was in charge of the cows, horses, ducks and geese that lived here in the carriage house. The most important part of his job was to take care of these animals, especially the horses that pulled the Clemens family’s carriages and sleighs. Clara and Jean loved to sit up front in the carriage with Patrick and help him hold the reins. He also went out with the girls riding on horseback. Jean loved horses so much that her father joked she might grow up to be a jockey and live in the stable!
