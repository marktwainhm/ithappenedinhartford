Financial problems forced Samuel  and Olivia to close up their Hartford home and to move the family to Europe in 1891. The family would never live in Hartford again. Susy’s death in 1896 made it too hard for Olivia to return to their Hartford home, and the Clemenses sold the property in 1903 to the Richard Bissell family. 

The Bissells lived in the house until 1917. For the next four years they rented the building to the Kingswood School for boys. In 1922 the house was sold to a developer, who immediately made plans to turn the house into an apartment building. According to a 1923 Hartford Courant article, “The apartments will be ready for occupancy on July 1. There will be eleven apartments and in the basement there is to be a large dining hall to be used for commercial purposes or for functions arranged by the tenants. Each apartment will have a large room with a fireplace and there will be three small bedrooms with folding beds ingeniously worked into the panels of the doors.”

GRID - The Bissell’s 
---------------------

Richard M. Bissell was president of The Hartford Fire Insurance Company for twenty-eight years and was described as “tall, distinguished looking, quietly confident, and able” according to a history of the company. However, his son described him as a “somewhat distant figure at home.” The Bissell family purchased the Clemens family home in 1903 for $28,800 and moved in shortly thereafter. Richard’s wife, Marie, was “a midwestener who found Hartford society stuffy,” says historian Eugene R. Gaddis. “Even during Prohibition, champagne flowed liberally at her soirees, and on the morning after at least one party, a grand piano was spotted on her front lawn.” She later became a patron of the legendary director of the Wadsworth Atheneum (link) art museum, A. Everett “Chick” Austin, who in the 1930s brough the likes of Gertrude Stein, Piet Mondrian, and George Balanchine, to Hartford. The Bissell’s raised three children in the home: William, Richard Bissell Jr., and Anne-Caroline. William kept a pet alligator in the Clemenses’ conservatory.

He is viewed as one of the most significant spies in CIA history.  

GRID - The Kingswood School for Boys
------------------------------------

The school’s history started in 1909 as the Oxford School, which was all girls. The school was an alternative education for gifted and ambitious students who preferred to stay locally rather than go to a far-off boarding school. Several years after the school opened a group of leading Hartford families looked for help instructing their sons and recruited a graduate of the Kingswood School in England named George Nicholson. They opened the Kingswood School for boys in 1916 which modeled itself after the British School tradition. When the Bissell family (Link) moved to Farmington in 1917 they decided to lease the Hartford house to the Kingswood School where they remained for four years. The library became an assembly hall, the drawing room a library, and the carriage house a gymnasium. Both schools thrived immensely over the next several decades and in the late 1960s the Kingswood School’s headmaster proposed joining with the Oxford school to create a co-educational setting. In 1969 they joined together to form the present-day Kingswood Oxford School.

GRID - Apartments
-----------------

In 1920 the Bissells (link) sold the property to a real estate investor, J.J. Wall, and two brothers in the undertaking business, John and Francis Ahern for $55,000. Two months later, a notice appeared in the Hartford Courant announcing that the new owners proposed to raze it and build an apartment building. Protests emerged from the community to save the Mark Twain House and a campaign was launched to do just that. Eventually these efforts fizzled but the owners, remaining cautious of the publicity, converted the rooms of the house into individual apartments, rather than demolish it. They noted that the walls could easily be removed “in the event of its being desired to restore the interior to its original condition or as a memorial to Mark Twain.” In 1925, Wall and the Aherns sold the house to new owners for $82,500. Katherine Seymour Day (link) stepped in soon after to acquire the house and save it permanently. On April 29, 1929 a charter was issued to the Mark Twain Memorial and Library Commission. The price of the house was reduced to $150,000, with a mortgage of $55,000. To help pay the mortgage the Hartford Public Library rented the ground floor and the Memorial continued to rent the upper floors as apartments.
