In November 1871, Olivia Clemens viewed a parcel of land in what was the budding Nook Farm neighborhood on the outskirts of Hartford. A month later she wrote to her husband, “I think I have decided what we shall do about building. I have decided so you will not have to decide, Dear Heart.” It was this parcel of land that would be the first of many land purchases between 1871 and 1876 that would become the Clemenses eight-acre estate. 

When the Clemens family lived here, Nook Farm was a rural community on the outskirts of the City of Hartford. The Park River flowed by at the base of the hill and pastures were the main feature of the landscape between the silhouettes of their friends’ homes. The two defining structural features of the Clemens’ grounds were the Carriage House and the greenhouse. 

## Carriage House
The carriage house was built in 1874  at the same time and in the same style as the main house. The carriage had stalls for horses and cows, space to park the carriages, a hayloft, and an apartment for the coachman, Patrick McAleer and his family. Today the three floors – a basement, main floor, and upper floor – are used for administrative, mechanical, and event space. 

## Greenhouse
When the Clemenses lived here there was a large greenhouse on the lawn between their house and the home of Harriet Beecher Stowe. Olivia Clemens loved having fresh flowers in the house and the family employed gardeners who tended to the greenhouse plants and the many gardens around the property. 

The greenhouse’s origin story dates to March 1881 when Samuel and Olivia Clemens saw workmen digging across the lawn in front of their house. (The front door faced the rear of the neighboring property.) Lawyer Franklin Chamberlin, who had sold them their land, was preparing the  site for a large stone house to be built at the corner of Farmington Avenue and Forest Street. That house’s rear windows would gaze down on the Clemens front door, “big and high, and his kitchen in their faces'' as neighbor Lilly Warner wrote. . Negotiations led to the sale of a 100-foot strip of land as a buffer – a strip that included a greenhouse Chamberlain had constructed in 1871.

Warner wrote of Olivia’s pride in presenting her with a vase of white roses “from her new greenhouse.” For the next decade, under the supervision of gardeners including Daniel Molloy and John and Ellen O’Neil, the greenhouse provided cut flowers for the Clemens tables and events. When daughter Susy Clemens held her 15th birthday party in March 1886, she was able to have unseasonable fresh nasturtiums on the table. And when the family left the house for Europe in 1891, the O’Neills, staying on as caretakers, sold perennials out of the greenhouse.

Sometime after 1910, the greenhouse was removed from the property. It may have found a home at a nursery in Bristol, Connecticut for the decades to follow, but as of 2020 the structure reported to be the Clemenses greenhouse had been destroyed. 

## The Park River
The Park River was a celebrated feature of Bushnell Park when it was created in the 1860s. Going by  the “Little River” and the “Hog River” earlier in its existence, the Park River was renamed to that when Jacob Wedinman planned his green oasis in the middle of Hartford. The Park River, then and now, connects to the Connecticut River, and was used for manufacturing, mills, tanneries, and transportation for decades. The creation of the Bushnell Park was in part to push those industries out of the city and replace them with nature. 

Since the Park River is connected to the Connecticut River it was subject to the seasonal swelling of its bigger connection causing flooding along the whole of the tributary. Each year the flooding would return and got so bad that starting in the 1940s the Army Corps of Engineers began to bury the river in a huge concrete box-shaped tunnel, 30 feet high and 45 feet wide. The work lasted through the 1980s. Today it runs straight as an arrow through the center of the park underneath the pump house, Pulaski Circle and Main Street, under the Hartford Public Library and the Conland-Whitehead Highway, finally arriving at the Connecticut River. The other direction, you can’t see it now, but the Park River runs beneath our feet! The river once entered Bushnell Park near the State Armory, and meandered along the Park’s northside where Asylum, Ford, and Jewel Streets now edge the Park. And it still flows, mostly underground, all the way to the Mark Twain House. 

The Clemenses’ Hartford home was a part of the neighborhood known as Nook Farm. This tight-knit community including families such as the Clemenses, Hookers, Beechers, Gillettes, Warners, Hawleys, and Burtons, among others, got its name from the bend, or “nook,” in the Park River which bordered the area to the west and south. When you visit the Mark Twain House today, the Park River runs below ground along the base of the hill, where today we have a footpath and a section of our guest parking lot.
