The Clemens family — Samuel, Olivia, Langdon, Susy, Clara, and Jean – called Hartford their home for 17 years. 

Samuel and Olivia married in February of 1870 and welcomed their first child, a son, Langdon in November that same year. Sadly, Langdon contracted diphtheria and died at 19 months old. Daughter Susy had been born in 1872, and daughter Clara arrived in summer 1874, shortly before they moved into their new home on Farmington Avenue in Hartford. Six years later daughter Jean was added to the family.

The 1890s and 1900s were difficult years for the family, with two daughters dying in their 20s – Susy in 1896 and Jean in 1909. Samuel lost his beloved Olivia in 1904. Samuel Clemens died in 1910, leaving daughter Clara as the sole survivor of the family and keeper of the author’s legacy. Today the Mark Twain House & Museum’s mission is to tell the story of this family and their legacies.
