The family that settled in what is now known as the Mark Twain House had its origins in author Samuel Clemens’s dream newspaper assignment – to accompany a group of 73 fellow tourists on the nation’s first true ocean cruise on the steamship Quaker City for five months in 1867. 
The route was to take the ship from New York through the Mediterranean to what was then called the Holy Land, the area now encompassing Israel, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon, with side trips by rail. His dispatches home to the San Francisco newspaper Alta California were full of elegant descriptions of architecture and landscape – and hilarious swipes at European sophistication and American innocence.  The book that resulted, The Innocents Abroad, started Samuel’s literary career in earnest.  

One of his fellow travelers was a 18-year-old boy from Elmira, New York, named Charles Langdon whose parents had sent him on the trip to improve his education. One day, as the Quaker City was anchored in the Bay of Smyrna, Langdon showed Clemens a miniature portrait of his sister Olivia, and (so the story goes) the author fell in love with her on sight. 

He courted her in Elmira and New York City – their first date was to hear Charles Dickens read Steinway Hall in New York City, and her parents came along. Rebuffed at first, he finally convinced her to marry, and the knot was tied on February 2, 1870 in her parents home in Elmira. Their marriage was very much a partnership as well as a love affair. Clemens would leave pages for Olivia to read and review, valuing her suggestions and edits. He said of Olivia: “I take as much pride in her brains as I do in her beauty.”

Son Langdon was born in November, but this was before the days of vaccines, and the boy contracted diphtheria and died at 19 months. Daughter Susy had been born in 1872, and daughter Clara arrived in summer 1874, shortly before they moved into the Farmington Avenue house. Six years later daughter Jean was added to the family.

The 1890s and 1900s were difficult years for the family, with two daughters dying in their 20s – Susy in 1896 and Jean in 1909. Samuel lost his beloved Olivia in 1904, and he died in 1910, leaving daughter Clara as the sole survivor of the family and keeper of the author’s legacy.
