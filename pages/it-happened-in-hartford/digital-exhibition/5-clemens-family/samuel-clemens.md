## A Life Lived in a Rapidly Changing World: Samuel L. Clemens‚ 1835-1910

Samuel Clemens (1835-1910), creator of the persona of Mark Twain, lived through the rapid changes of full-scale 19th century American industrialization, nationalism (and Civil War), westward expansion and eminent domain over indigenous lands, imperialism, as well as the social and economic changes that accompanied these massive shifts during America’s Gilded Age. In all of this, Clemens was a sharp observer of the people and cultures around him, albeit through the lens of a white man who grew up during legalized slavery.  
 
However, Clemens’ understanding of the world changed over time as he moved from the South of his childhood, to the West and North, as well as Europe, and as he encountered different people, raised a family, and sought to make a living as a writer and performer. He started his career without the safety net of personal family wealth, and married into a wealthy family, allowing him some respite from precarity, but never enough. His life was a constant drive for economic stability; he built and lost several fortunes.  Over time, Clemens—and thus Twain--came to be a sharp critic of the American Dream, recognizing a false promise and the power of classism and racism in America. Over his life Clemens changed his opinions about slavery, racism, imperialism and more. He questioned gender norms and roles and recognized the performative nature of these cultural concepts. He also came to oppose America’s growing imperialism. At the same time his views of the indigenous people of America, remained deeply racist and problematic as were his views of Asian people.

  <p>Samuel Clemens was born on November 30, 1835 in Florida, Missouri, the sixth of seven children. At age 4, Samuel and his family moved to the small frontier town of Hannibal, Missouri, on the banks of the Mississippi River. Missouri at the time, was a fairly new state (it had gained statehood in 1821) on the country’s western border, with legalized slavery; Samuel’s father owned one enslaved person, and his uncle owned several. In fact, it was on his uncle’s farm that Samuel spent many boyhood summers playing in the enslaved people’s quarters, listening to tall tales and the spirituals that he would enjoy throughout his life.</p>
  <p>In 1847, when Samuel was 11, his father died. Shortly thereafter he left school to work as a printer’s apprentice for a local newspaper. His job was to arrange the type for each of the newspaper’s stories, allowing Samuel to read the news of the world while completing his work.</p>

<div class="content">
  <p>At 18, Samuel headed east to New York City and Philadelphia, where he worked on several different newspapers and found some success at writing articles. By 1857‚ he had returned home to embark on a new career as a riverboat pilot on the Mississippi River. With the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, however, all traffic along the river came to a halt, as did Samuel’s pilot career. Inspired by the times, Samuel joined up with a volunteer [Confederate unit called the Marion Rangers](https://marktwainstudies.com/mark-twain-forum-book-reviews-mark-twains-civil-war-edited-by-benjamin-griffin/), but he quit after just two weeks.</p>
  <p>In search of a new career, Samuel headed west in July 1861, at the invitation of his brother, Orion, who had just been appointed secretary of the Nevada Territory. Lured by the infectious hope of striking it rich in Nevada’s silver rush, Samuel traveled across the open frontier from Missouri to Nevada by stagecoach. Along the journey Samuel encountered Indigenous peoples for the first time, along with a variety of unique characters, mishaps, and disappointments. These events would find a way into his short stories and books‚ particularly [Roughing It](https://marktwainhouse.org/about/mark-twain/major-works/).</p>
  <p>After failing as a silver prospector‚ Samuel began writing for the Territorial Enterprise‚ a Virginia City‚ Nevada newspaper where he used‚ for the first time‚ his pen name‚ Mark Twain. Seeking change yet again, by 1864 Samuel headed for San Francisco where he continued to write for local papers.</p>
  <p>In 1865 Samuel’s first “big break” came with the publication of his short story “Jim Smiley and His Jumping Frog ” in papers across the country. A year later Samuel was hired by the Sacramento *Union* to visit and report on the Sandwich Islands (now Hawaii). His writings were so popular that upon his return, he embarked upon his first lecture tour, which established him as a successful stage performer.</p>
  <p>Hired by the Alta California to continue his travel writing from the east‚ Samuel arrived in New York City in 1867. He quickly signed up for a steamship tour of Europe and the “Holy Land.” His travel letters‚ full of vivid descriptions and tongue-in-cheek observations‚ met with such audience approval that they were later reworked into his first book‚ [*The Innocents Abroad*](https://marktwainhouse.org/about/mark-twain/major-works/), published in 1869. It was also on this trip that Clemens met his future brother-in-law, Charles Langdon. As the story goes, Langdon reportedly showed Samuel a picture of his sister‚ [Olivia](https://marktwainhouse.org/about/mark-twain/sam-clemens-family/olivia-livy-langdon-clemens/)‚ and Samuel fell in love at first sight.</p>

<div class="content">
  <p>After courting for two years, Samuel Clemens and Olivia (Livy) Langdon were married in 1870. They settled in a house gifted to them by Olivia’s father in Buffalo‚ New York and near her wealthy and connected family. Samuel become a partner‚ editor, and writer for the daily newspaper the *Buffalo Express*. While they were living in Buffalo, their first child, Langdon Clemens, was born.</p>
  <p>In 1871 Samuel moved his family to Hartford, Connecticut, a city he had come to love while visiting his publisher there and where he had made friends. Olivia also had family connections to the city. For the first few years the Clemenses rented a house in the heart of Nook Farm, a residential area that was home to numerous writers, publishers, and other prominent figures. In 1872 Samuel’s recollections and tall tales from his frontier adventures were published in his book [*Roughing It*](https://marktwainhouse.org/about/mark-twain/major-works/). That same year the Clemenses’ first daughter Susy was born, but their son, Langdon, died at age two from diphtheria.</p>
  <p>In 1873 Samuel’s focus turned toward social criticism. He and Hartford Courant publisher Charles Dudley Warner co-wrote [*The Gilded Age*](https://marktwainhouse.org/about/mark-twain/major-works/)‚ a novel that attacked political corruption‚ big business, and the American obsession with getting rich that seemed to dominate the era. Ironically, a year after its publication, Clemenses’ elaborate 25-room house on Farmington Avenue, which had cost the then-huge sum of $40‚000-$45‚000‚ was completed.</p>

<div class="content">
  <p>For the next 17 years (1874-1891), Samuel‚ Olivia, and their three daughters (Clara followed first daughter Susy in 1874 and Jean in 1880) lived in the Hartford home. During those years Samuel completed some of his most famous books, often finding a summer refuge for uninterrupted work at his sister-in-law’s farm in Elmira, New York. Novels such as [*The Adventures of Tom Sawyer*](https://marktwainhouse.org/about/mark-twain/major-works/) (1876) and [*Life on the Mississippi*](https://marktwainhouse.org/about/mark-twain/major-works/) (1883) captured both his Missouri memories and depictions of the American scene. Yet his social commentary continued. [*The Prince and the Pauper*](https://marktwainhouse.org/about/mark-twain/major-works/) (1881) explored class relations, as does [*A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court*](https://marktwainhouse.org/about/mark-twain/major-works/) (1889), which‚ going a step further‚ criticized oppression in general while examining the period’s explosion of new technologies. And‚ in perhaps his most famous work‚ [*Adventures of Huckleberry Finn*](https://marktwainhouse.org/about/mark-twain/major-works/) (1884)‚ Clemens‚ by the way he attacked the institution of slavery‚ railed against the failures of Reconstruction and the continued poor treatment of African Americans in his own time.</p>
  <p>[*Huckleberry Finn*](https://marktwainhouse.org/about/mark-twain/major-works/) was also the first book published by Samuel’s own publishing company‚ The Charles L. Webster Company. In an attempt to gain control over publication as well as to make substantial profits, Samuel created the company in 1884. A year later he contracted with Ulysses S. Grant to publish Grant’s memoirs; the two-volume set provided large royalties for Grant’s widow and was a financial success for the publisher as well.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Twain’s Financial Ruin and Subsequent Travels</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Although Samuel enjoyed financial success during his Hartford years, he continually made bad investments in new inventions, which eventually brought him to bankruptcy. In an effort to economize and pay back his debts, Samuel and Olivia moved their family to Europe in 1891. When his publishing company failed in 1894, Samuel was forced to set out on a worldwide lecture tour to earn money. </p>
  <p>In 1896 tragedy struck when Susy Clemens, at age 24, died from meningitis while on a visit to the Hartford home. Unable to bear being in the place of her death, the Clemenses never returned to Hartford to live.</p>
  <p>From 1891 until 1900‚ Samuel and his family traveled throughout the world. During those years Samuel witnessed the increasing exploitation of weaker governments by European powers‚ which he described in his book [*Following the Equator*](https://marktwainhouse.org/about/mark-twain/major-works/) (1897). The Boer War in South Africa and the Boxer Rebellion in China fueled his growing anger toward imperialistic countries and their actions. With the Spanish-American and Philippine wars in 1898‚ Samuel’s wrath was redirected toward the American government. When he returned to the United States in 1900, his finances restored, Samuel readily declared himself an anti-imperialist and, from 1901 until his death, served as the vice president of the Anti-Imperialist League.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Twain’s Darkest Times and Late Life</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>In these later years, Samuel's writings turned dark. His works began to focus on human greed and cruelty and questioned the humanity of the human race. His public speeches followed suit and included a harshly sarcastic public introduction of Winston Churchill in 1900. Even though Samuel’s lecture tour had managed to get him out of debt, his anti-government writings and speeches threatened his livelihood once again. As Samuel was labeled by some as a traitor, several of his works were never published during his lifetime, either because magazines would not accept them or because of his own personal fear that his marketable reputation would be ruined.</p>
  <p>In 1903, after living in New York City for three years, Olivia became ill, and Samuel and his wife returned to Italy, where she died a year later. After her death, Samuel lived in New York until 1908, when he moved into his last house, “Stormfield,” in Redding, Connecticut. In 1909 his middle daughter Clara was married. In the same year Jean, the youngest daughter, died from an epileptic seizure. Four months later, on April 21, 1910, Samuel Clemens died at age 74.</p>
  <p>Like any good journalist, Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, spent his life observing and reporting on his surroundings. In his writings he provided images of the romantic, the real, the strengths and weaknesses of a rapidly changing world. By examining his life and his works, we can read into the past – piecing together various events of the era and the responses to them. We can delve into the American mindset of the late nineteenth century and make our own observations of history, discover new connections, create new inferences and gain better insights into the time period and the people who lived in it. As Samuel once wrote, “Supposing is good, but finding out is better.”</p>
