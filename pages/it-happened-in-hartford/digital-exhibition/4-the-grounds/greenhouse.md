When the Clemenses lived here there was a large greenhouse on the lawn between their house and the home of Harriet Beecher Stowe. Olivia Clemens loved having fresh flowers in the house and the family employed gardeners who tended to the greenhouse plants and the many gardens around the property. 

The greenhouse’s origin story dates to March 1881 when Samuel and Olivia Clemens saw workmen digging across the lawn in front of their house. (The front door faced the rear of the neighboring property.) Lawyer Franklin Chamberlin, who had sold them their land, was preparing the  site for a large stone house to be built at the corner of Farmington Avenue and Forest Street. That house’s rear windows would gaze down on the Clemens front door, “big and high, and his kitchen in their faces'' as neighbor Lilly Warner wrote. . Negotiations led to the sale of a 100-foot strip of land as a buffer – a strip that included a greenhouse Chamberlain had constructed in 1871.

Warner wrote of Olivia’s pride in presenting her with a vase of white roses “from her new greenhouse.” For the next decade, under the supervision of gardeners including Daniel Molloy and John and Ellen O’Neil, the greenhouse provided cut flowers for the Clemens tables and events. When daughter Susy Clemens held her 15th birthday party in March 1886, she was able to have unseasonable fresh nasturtiums on the table. And when the family left the house for Europe in 1891, the O’Neills, staying on as caretakers, sold perennials out of the greenhouse.

Sometime after 1910, the greenhouse was removed from the property. It may have found a home at a nursery in Bristol, Connecticut for the decades to follow, but as of 2020 the structure reported to be the Clemenses greenhouse had been destroyed.
