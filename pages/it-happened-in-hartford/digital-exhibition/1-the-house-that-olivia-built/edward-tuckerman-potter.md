Edward Tuckerman Potter designed the Clemens house in Hartford. Mainly known for his church architecture, and for an octagonal Moorish-style building in the midst of the Union College campus in Schenectady, New York, complete with a mosque-like dome, Potter had upstate New York roots. His father was a bishop in the Episcopal Church. Potter designed churches throughout Northeast and Midwest America, influenced by his teacher, Richard Upjohn, who in turn was inspired by the English art critic John Ruskin, who called for rooting current architecture in England’s own Gothic traditions rather than the Roman-inspired architecture of the 18th century.

Potter’s interest in churches led him to write church music as well. He was described by contemporaries as a gentle man with a good singing voice and a love of fine food and literature.  He had done work in and around Hartford, including the Church of the Holy Shepherd in the city’s South Meadows, a job for Elizabeth Colt, the widow and business successor of six-gun manufacturer Samuel Colt. The building still displays in carved bas-relief the weapons that brought the Colts their fame and wealth.
