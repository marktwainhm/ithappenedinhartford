Born in East Haddam, Connecticut, Morgan Garden Bulkeley and his family relocated to the capitol city not long after where he received his formal education. He moved to Brooklyn, New York for his first job before the outbreak of Civil War where he served briefly albeit saw no action. After the death of his father, Bulkeley moved back to Hartford and settled down as a bank president and a board member of Aetna Insurance Company (becoming President in 1879 until the end of his life). Though he had little experience in baseball, he became the first president of the National League when the Hartford Dark Blues applied for membership in 1876; he served for one season. Bulkeley spent most of his life in politics and served as mayor of Hartford for two terms, followed by governor of Connecticut for two terms, and ended as a U.S. Senator from 1905 until 1911. 

He spent his final years involved in philanthropy, helping to give back to the community where he spent the majority of his life. After his death in 1922, the city decided to name a bridge and a high school in his honor. According to Bulkeley’s biographer Kevin Murphy, “He [Bulkeley] was shrewd, pragmatic, sometimes wildly vindictive – but he was also courteous, loyal, and even kind. He wasn’t a ‘man for all season,’ but he accomplished an enormous amount without receiving even a high school diploma. In the pantheon of Connecticut politics, he has his own special place..”
