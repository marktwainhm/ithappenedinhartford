Potter finished construction on the main section of the Clemenses Hartford home in 1875. It wasn’t until 1881, that the Clemenses started on the projects left aside for economic reasons during the 1874-75 construction.  They were able to expand the kitchen wing of the house toward Farmington Avenue and set to work on improving the interior decoration of the house.  The Clemenses first contacted Herbert M. Lawrence, a decorator who had done work for their friends, the Cheney silk magnates of Manchester, Connecticut. Lawrence was in Europe, but recommended a number of alternatives—including “Mr. Louis Tiffany.”

With help from Olivia’s mother, money earned from Samuel’s speaking tours, and the influx of funds provided by the publication of Adventures of Tom Sawyer in 1876, the Clemenses were able to hire Louis C. Tiffany’s interior design team, Associated Artists, to decorate the walls and ceilings of the first floor – the public spaces -- of the house. 

Associated Artists were members of the Aesthetic movement, and were known for their exotic interiors. The same year they decorated the Mark Twain House interior they were hired by U.S. President Chester Arthur to redecorate the state rooms of the White House. The company was made up of four designers: Louis C. Tiffany, Candace Wheeler, Lockwood DeForest, and Samuel Coleman. Each brought ideas from different parts of the world where they had traveled and studied, and each had a hand in the design of the Mark Twain House interior. As a result, the first floor of the house is filled with design motifs from Morocco‚ India, Japan‚ China and Turkey.

The furnishing and decoration in the public spaces of the house were important signifiers of social class–and Samuel, who didn’t grow up with wealth,  was new to this world and simultaneously afraid to make a wrong move and a little contemptuous of it all. Olivia was far more comfortable with the language of social class, although new to Hartford wealthy society. She took the lead in steering the family through the precarious world of high society, something they both understood to be necessary in building the career of Mark Twain–public figure.

## GRID: Louis Comfort Tiffany (1848-1933)
Tiffany was the son of the founder of the great New York jewelry firm, Charles Tiffany, but seems to have been more fun than his somewhat strait-laced father, frequenting the nightspots of Broadway with the architect Stanford White—who designed the Washington Square arch, and was later shot to death by a jealous husband—and James Steele Mackaye, a theater manager, playwright, actor, and inventor who devised the idea of folding theater seats. In 1879, Tiffany had collected a small group of similarly minded designers together—Samuel Colman, Lockwood DeForest, and Candace Wheeler—in a venture called Associated Artists. Tiffany’s surviving letter serving as a contract with Clemens was quite unspecific: “Walls papered and stenciled . . . Ceiling papered and stenciled in metals . . . Woodwork decorated or not, at our option.”

Associated Artists disbanded after a short tenure, but they did have other important commissions, including  also the Madison Square Theater (for Mackaye), and a room in the White House. (Associated Artists’ 1885 work was removed by President Theodore Roosevelt less than two decades later, the idea being to restore the style of the building to its Federal origins – lavish Victorian stained glass screens just wouldn’t work.)

Tiffany went on to pursue his interest in glassmaking -- the work for which he is best known. He established the Tiffany Glass Company in 1885, eventually employing more than 300 artisans. His stained glass windows and lamps are famous, but his firms also produced pottery and other furnishings.  On his father’s death, he was appointed the first design director and vice president of Tiffany & Co. While the jewelry firm survives today, Tiffany’s own glass creations were no longer fashionable in the 1910s and 1920s, and the Depression led to his company’s demise.

## GRID: Candace Wheeler (1827-1923)
The American designer Candace Wheeler was deeply associated with the Clemenses and their home, both as an important participant in the interior redecoration and later as a family friend. 

Inspired by a British movement to teach needlework skills to women, she founded the New York Society of Decorative Art in 1877 and the New York Exchange for Women’s Work in 1878.  In 1879 she and Louis Comfort Tiffany, a scion of the jewelry family, founded the interior design firm Tiffany & Wheeler, which with the addition of other artists became Louis C. Tiffany & Co., Associated Artists. Wheeler was responsible primarily for the firm’s textile designs, and is mentioned briefly in Clemens’s journal in relation to the 1881 redecoration of the house, but the family friendship did not blossom until the mid-1880s. 

As one of America’s first female interior and textile designers, she became known as the “mother” of interior design, opening the field to other women and supporting their right to work and exercise economic independence. While Wheeler wrote several books on design, her career as an artist lay mainly in textile and wallpaper design, modeling colors and patterns on American flowers and responding to the qualities of light.

Wheeler’s daughter, Dora Wheeler Keith, painted  portraits of Clemens family members and others in Hartford, including the portrait of Samuel Clemens displayed on the third-floor landing of the house today. The Clemenses paid a visit in the summer of 1890 to Wheeler’s artistic colony, the Onteora Club, in New York State. In later life she was highly regarded as a designer, and directed the interior decoration of the Women’s Pavilion of the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Her 1880s “Honeycomb” and “Spiderwebs” wallpaper designs were used in the 2016 restoration of the “Mahogany Room” guest suite in the Mark Twain House.

## GRID: Lockwood de Forest (1850-1932)
Lockwood De Forest was one of the Associated Artists group, led by Louis Comfort Tiffany, who were brought into the Clemens home in 1881 to “revamp” the decoration, as Samuel Clemens described their task. An expansion of the house’s kitchen wing was accompanied by a major interior design project. 

De Forest was a painter and designer with a particular interest in Indian art and design. The painter Frederic Church was a mentor to the young man during his European travels in the 1860s, and de Forest later set up a studio in New York. After he joined Tiffany and designer Candace Wheeler in the Associated Artists firm De Forest traveled to India with his wife – on their honeymoon. 

“When I reached Ahmedabad [in the current state of Gujarat] ... and saw street after street of carved houses and the many beautiful mosques of yellow sandstone, also elaborately carved, with their wonderful tracery windows, I made up my mind to have copies made of some of them no matter what difficulties I had to meet,” he wrote. De Forest ended up spending two years in India, ultimately setting up a teak carving and brass metalwork company in Ahmedabad, a city in eastern India in the state of Gujarat. This company supplied many prominent homes with décor and furniture, including Olana, the mountaintop mansion of the artist Church, and the New York home of the industrialist Andrew Carnegie. 

The firm created the pierced brass sheets around the fireplace in the front hall and another in the drawing room. Of the first fireplace, Clemens suggested in a letter “to paint the white marble (which immediately surrounds the hall fireplace) the same strong red of the hall walls, & then cover it with Mr. De Forest’s thin arabesque cut brass sheets, which will let the red show through.” And so it appears today.

## GRID: Samuel Colman (1832-1920)
As one of the Associated Artists group led by Louis Tiffany and Candace Wheeler, Samuel Colman had a role in the major interior redecoration of the Clemens home in Hartford in 1881. He is best known, though, as a member of the Hudson River School of landscape painters. He exhibited at the National Academy of Design in New York at the age of 18. He traveled extensively in Europe and the western United States, where he also set up his easel to convey landscape and architectural features in a Romantic style. Possibly his best-known work is the five-foot-by-three-foot painting Storm King on the Hudson, which shows the looming riverside mountain in the Hudson Highlands with a variety of sail and steam boats in the foreground. 

It’s not clear what Colman’s role was in the Clemens redecoration, but the group’s next job was the Blue Room (which no longer exists) in the White House. and Tiffany and Colman are listed as being in charge of color choices. The other two members of the group were Lockwood De Forest, in charge of the woodwork, and Candace Wheeler, in charge of textiles.

Colman was the author of Nature’s Harmonic Unity: A Treatise on Its Relation to Proportional Form (1912), which drew parallels between the mathematical proportions of nature (such as the form of a seashell or  flower) and those of art and architecture.

## GRID: Walter Crane (1845-1915)
The wallpaper in the Clemens children’s nursery in the Hartford house is a reproduction of scraps found when part of a fireplace in the room was removed in 1968 while the house was going through restoration. The wallpaper was decorated with illustrations by Walter Crane, the British illustrator influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement and by Japanese woodblock prints. His children’s book illustrations were colorful and elegant. Like his friend William Morris, he was a devoted socialist and his work appeared in radical publications of the era. This wallpaper was one of seven nursery wallpapers Crane designed for Jeffrey and Company, a London firm that also produced Morris’s designs. The wallpapers were machine printed and literary in subject matter. 
The nursery illustrations portray scenes from the nursery rhyme “A Frog He Would A-Wooing Go…” 

> *A frog he would a-wooing go,*
> *Heigh ho! says Rowley,*
> *A frog he would a-wooing go,*
> *Whether his mother would let him or no.*
> *With a rowley, powley, gammon, and spinach,*
> *Heigh ho! says Anthony Rowley.*

…known perhaps better in America in its Appalachian variant, “Froggy Went A-Courting.”

> *Frog went a-courtin', and he did ride, Uh-huh,*
> *Frog went a-courtin', and he did ride, Uh-huh,*
> *Frog went a-courtin', and he did ride.*
> *With a sword and a pistol by his side, Uh-huh.*

## GRID: Frederick Schweppe (1837-1892)
The Clemenses spent much of the years 1878-79 in Europe, where Samuel was preparing material for his book A Tramp Abroad. But another major purpose of his and Olivia’s stay was to buy and ship home furnishings, art, and statuary for a planned redecoration of their Hartford home. On their return, as Samuel wrote to a friend, “Livy is viewing designs and instructing the artist who is making ready to fresco the Hartford house.” The work he was talking about was on the second floor, the family’s living area, and the artist was Frederick Schweppe of Olivia’s hometown of Elmira, New York.

Schweppe was born in Germany and emigrated to the United States in 1865. He worked in New York City before setting up shop in Elmira in the 1870s. He used Austrian pattern books, which showed borders and wall designs; artists of the time would sometimes combine such elements in “composite” patterns. In November Olivia wrote to her mother: “We like exceedingly the work that Mr. Schweppe put on the house…the house is exceedingly pretty and so wonderfully improved. The nursery” – which featured wallpaper designed by British artist Walter Crane – “is perfect.” Schweppe was paid $250 for the work, about $5,000 in present-day money.
