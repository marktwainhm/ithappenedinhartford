Today about 17 of the original 25 rooms are restored and open to the public. The others are used for staff offices, storage, or were “removed” at some point in our history to allow for staircases to be installed between floors. 

## Front Hall 
The entrance hall provided an appropriately impressive area for receiving visitors. Leon Marcotte of New York and Paris carved the entrance hall’s ornamental detail when the house was built. In 1881, the interior design firm of Louis C. Tiffany & Co., Associated Artists, was hired to stencil the room’s original wainscoting in silver, and paint the walls and ceiling red with patterns of black and silver. They drew inspiration from the other cultures such as the Middle East and Asia to form a cohesive design scheme that flowed throughout the first floor and public spaces of the house.

### Front Hall Marble Floor

Restoration work on the entry hall marble floor began in February 2003 and was completed in May 2003. As an architecturally significant component of the house, we took a restoration approach to the floor: Repairing and cleaning what was there, unless not repairable, in which case we matched the old material in composition, design and color. A treatment plan based on these principles ensured contractors would properly restore the floor.

To compensate for an uneven brick sub-floor and varying depths for the substrate, the contractors installed on top of the substrate a crack suppression material. This material will prevent movement of the substrate from being transmitted to the tile in the form of cracks. The new floor installation system, on which the restored marble tiles were fastened, was designed to accommodate the growing visitor traffic for years to come.

### Hallway Stenciling
The distinctive stencils throughout the hallways on the second and third floors of The Mark Twain House are another feature of the Louis Comfort Tiffany interior decoration of 1881. The normal wear on the stenciling, which was refinished during the original restoration of the house in the 1960s, necessitated a re-stenciling in 2003-04, as well as the touch-up of the decorative painting and the refinishing of woodwork.

Master stencil artist Leo Sans, a German-born painter who was trained in traditional painting and stenciling methods more than half a century ago, worked on the original restoration in the 1960s. In 2003, he returned to The Mark Twain House with his son, Matt, to restore the luster to the hallway stencils and woodwork.

The colors of the painted and stenciled canvas applied to the walls had become particularly faded in the 3rd floor hallway. The stencil patterns there originally (both in the Clemens period and after the 1970s restoration) were gold bronze, appearing gold in color. The original appears dark green over the lighter green field earlier stencil pattern colors now appear bronze due to fading caused by the sun. Both colors started out looking gold.

## Drawing Room
The drawing room was the scene of formal entertaining. Associated Artists stenciled the walls and ceiling of this room in silver East Indian motifs over salmon pink. The large pier glass mirror was a wedding gift that the Clemens’ brought to Hartford from their first home in Buffalo, New York. The tufted furniture and chandelier also belonged to the family during their residence here

## Dining Room
The family ate most of their meals in the dining room, from small family suppers to formal, elegant dinner parties. In 1881 the walls were covered with a rich embossed paper of red and gold to simulate the look of tooled leather. The pattern of lilies is typical of the work of Candace Wheeler, a textile artist and partner in Associated Artists.  Fragments of the original wallpaper were found during the restoration. In 1972 the paper was recreated and installed. The walnut paneling and doors were covered with a delicate stenciling based on Chinese motifs. The kitchen and servants’ wing are located off the north end of this room.

## Library 
The library mantel is the focal point of the room where Clemens recited poetry, told stories and read excerpts from his new works to his family and friends. Samuel and Olivia purchased the large oak mantelpiece from Ayton Castle in Scotland specifically for their library. The Mitchell-Innes family crest appears on the overmantel, as well as the year “1874”, an alteration made by Samuel to reflect the year his family moved into their Hartford home. Samuel also added a brass smoke shield with the inscription “The ornament of a house is the friends who frequent it,” a quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson.

## Conservatory
Like many upper-class late Victorian homes, the Clemens home had a conservatory (a sunroom or greenhouse). Theirs had a fountain and was filled with lush, thriving plants. Clemens' daughters Susy‚ Clara and Jean called this room “The Jungle.”

## Mahogany Suite
The Mahogany Room, the best guest suite, reopened to the public in December, 2017. It is made up of a bedroom, dressing room, and bathroom. Writer W.D. Howells called it a “royal chamber.” Author Grace King compared it to the castle in “Beauty and the Beast.”  It served as a Green Room for family theatricals and a gift-wrapping station for Olivia’s charitable work.  The restoration, made possible by a 2014 state bonding grant, involved a fascinating bout of detective work and a hunt for authentic fixtures and decor, such as a final decision on whether the bathtub had a shower, and determining what year Candace Wheeler produced her honeycomb wallpaper.

#### Mahogany Suite Restoration

The Clemenses' best guest suite was made up of a bedroom, dressing room, and bathroom with every modern convenience. W.D. Howells called it a "royal chamber," and Grace King compared it to the castle in "Beauty and the Beast." It was a Green Room for the family theatricals and a gift-wrapping station for Olivia's charitable work. The restoration, made possible by the 2014 state bonding grant, involved a fascinating bout of detective work and a hunt for authentic fixtures and decor, ranging from a final decision on whether the bathtub had a shower, to what year Candace Wheeler produced her honeycomb wallpaper. An extraordinary, research-driven architectural firm and some legendary craftspeople have aided in this effort.

We worked with David Scott Parker Architects, an architectural firm that specializes in historic preservation and has extensive background knowledge of Louis Comfort Tiffany and the Associated Artists who are known to have decorated the bedroom. Little is known about the decoration of the suite, as the contract between the Clemenses and Associated Artists states that the bedroom will have its “walls and ceiling papered.” It is difficult to determine if the dressing room and bathroom were decorated by them as well. The firm used their knowledge of Associated Artists and the practices of the time period to determine the best approximation of how the room may have been decorated.

## Butler’s Pantry
This room was the domain of butler George Griffin, who worked for the family during their entire time in Hartford. The butler’s pantry was where fine China, crystal and the daily dishware and flatware were stored. This is also where Griffin did the necessary prep work for all of the Clemenses meals as food was passed through from the kitchen staff. 

## Kitchen, Scullery & Pantries 
Though a later addition, like the rest of the house, the kitchen, scullery, and pantries were built to the highest standards of the time. The sinks had running water and hot water. The stove was of the highest quality. And the kitchen featured an icebox – a modern and novel invention at the time that exemplified the Clemens’ high social and economic status. 

## Servants Hall 
The servant’s hall is where any one who lived and/or worked at the Clemenses’ Hartford home would take their meals and take any breaks their work load and schedule afforded them. There is also a door where all deliveries to the house would come through so as to not disrupt the social and business calls happening at the front door. 

### Servant’s Wing restoration
In 2003 and 2004, in anticipation of restoring the first floor of the Servants' Wing (previously used for museum offices), building archaeologists worked throughout the house searching for clues to work done in 1881 by masons, bricklayers, plumbers, painters and carpenters. The team of specialists discovered what the Twain-era floors looked like, the color the walls were painted, how the woodwork was finished, and how the rooms were partitioned. They discovered features long hidden and forgotten, such as a dumbwaiter and pass-throughs, and the location of sinks, gas light fixtures and speaking tubes. The cooking range space was carefully identified and a period range installed. Restoration work was completed in the butler's pantry, back pantry, kitchen, dumbwaiter, scullery, servant's hall and passageway to the Dining Room and the restored Butler's Pantry and kitchen area is open to the public as part of our regular tour of the House.

## Clemens Bedroom
The Clemens Bedroom, the private quarters of Clemens and his wife, is located on the second floor of the house. The couple’s elaborately carved bed, which they purchased in 1878 in Venice, dominates the space. Samuel kept it with him all his life, calling it “the most comfortable bedstead that ever was, with space enough in it for a family, and carved angels enough… To bring peace to the sleepers, and pleasant dreams.” Samuel Clemens died in this bed in his Redding, Connecticut home in 1910. Twain’s only surviving daughter, Clara, gave it to the museum in 1940.

## Susy’s Bedroom 
As the family grew and the three daughters got older, space was a commodity. While all three girls used the nursery room as babies and infants, as a pre-teen and teenager the eldest daughter Susy got her own room, while middle daughter Clara and the youngest Jean shared what was the nursery. 

### A Mysterious Window
During the long process of restoration we sometimes discover new information about the house, which we need to carefully evaluate to determine if it is a Clemens-era feature or one added by later occupants of The Mark Twain House. The oval interior window is a great example of this process.

Evidence tells researchers that at one point in the history of the house an interior window was prominently featured in the main stairwell, between the second-floor hall and Susy Clemens' room.

## Nursery 
Clara and Jean shared the nursery. (Susy, as the oldest child, had her own room.) The brass beds recall the ones that Clara remembered when she visited the museum in 1957 during the early phase of restoration. The wallpaper reproduces the original pattern by illustrator Walter Crane and tells the nursery rhyme “Ye Frog He Would A-Wooing Go” (or “Froggie went a-courtin’” as it is better known today) in words and pictures.

## Schoolroom
The schoolroom, originally designed as Twain’s study, later became a play area and classroom for his daughters. They were educated by their mother and a governess, who taught them German, history, geography, and arithmetic, among other subjects. The Fischer upright piano is the same year and model as the one they were given for Christmas in 1880. The wall and ceiling decorations were done in 1879 by an Elmira‚ NY decorator named Frederick Schweppe.

## Guest Room (Langdon Bedroom)
Where to put family when they come to visit is a challenge many of us can understand. So while constructing this house and as the family grew, Olivia Clemens made sure that there was a bedroom and bathroom available for family when they came to visit. Today we call this room the “Langdon Bedroom” as Olivia’s mother was the most frequent guest, often staying for months at a time. The furniture in the room is not original to this Hartford house, but actually came from the Langdon family home in Elmira, New York. 

## George Griffin’s Room 
While he had an apartment across town with his wife and child, George Griffin also had a room here in the Clemens’ home. His room was stationed on the third floor close to Clemens’ billiards room and the guest room reserved for his special guests. Most of the other live-in servants quarters were above the kitchen wing, so the proximity of Griffin’s room signifies his importance to the family. 

## Billiards Room  
The billiard room served as Mark Twain’s office, study and private domain. Located on the third floor, away from the bustle of a busy household, it was the place where the author would write his great works, fanning the manuscripts on the billiard table to be edited. Twain could relax and informally entertain friends, sometimes into the early morning hours. The billiard table now in the house was given to Samuel by a friend in 1904.

Twain’s biographer, Albert Bigelow Paine, wrote: “Every Friday evening, or oftener, a small party of billiard lovers gathered, and played until the late hour, told stories, smoked till the room was blue, comforting themselves with hot Scotch and general good-fellowship. Mark Twain always had a genuine passion for billiards. He never tired of the game. He could play all night. He could stay until the last man gave out from sheer weariness, then he would go on knocking the balls about alone.”

### Billiards Room Restoration 
Guided by a rigorously researched historic furnishings plan and painstaking analysis of physical evidence (e.g., historic mortar, wallpaper fragments, old carpet tacks and long-forgotten paint), The Mark Twain House & Museum restored the Billiard Room from floor to ceiling in 2003-04. In addition to the grand billiard table once owned by Twain, resting on a reproduction 1874 "Kinver Turkey" pattern carpet and illuminated by a restored gasolier, the details help tell the story of the room. Open books, papers scattered on the billiard table and floor, and notes tacked up on the wall suggest Twain was active as well as messy when he wrote.

The fireplace proved to be an exceptionally challenging architectural feature to restore. As early as the 1960s, when researchers first removed the existing brick face of the fireplace, they found a chimney mass of distressed brick, probably blackened by years of smoke migrating through the masonry joints. After much consideration, curators for this initial restoration decided that the best treatment for this feature was a fireplace face of ceramic tile mirroring the hearth (thought to be original), and wood mantel surround.

Curators at The Mark Twain House have always believed that the hearth, composed of green and red ceramic tiles, was original to the room when Twain kindled his fires there. The floral motif of the glazed green border tiles was a common Victorian motif and the earliest photographs of the room-from the 1950s show the tiles in place. The restoration confirmed our assumptions. Restoration work begun in 2003 revealed new physical evidence which, coupled with the only known Twain-era depiction of the room, allowed the Museum to more accurately portray the corner of the Billiard Room where Twain sat down to write, confirming the installation of a bookshelf during Twain's occupancy, which was recreated.

## Artist Friend’s Room 
The first floor was for the public, the second floor was for the family, and the third floor was Samuel Clemens domain, so this guest room on the third floor was reserved for special guests of his. Connected to the billiards room and close to the butler’s room as to be on call, this room was where Samuel’s friends could rest after days and nights of billiards, cigars, and drinking.
