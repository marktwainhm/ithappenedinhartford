The school’s history started in 1909 as the Oxford School, which was all girls. The school was an alternative education for gifted and ambitious students who preferred to stay locally rather than go to a far-off boarding school. Several years after the school opened a group of leading Hartford families looked for help instructing their sons and recruited a graduate of the Kingswood School in England named George Nicholson. They opened the Kingswood School for boys in 1916 which modeled itself after the British School tradition. When the Bissell family (Link) moved to Farmington in 1917 they decided to lease the Hartford house to the Kingswood School where they remained for four years. The library became an assembly hall, the drawing room a library, and the carriage house a gymnasium. Both schools thrived immensely over the next several decades and in the late 1960s the Kingswood School’s headmaster proposed joining with the Oxford school to create a co-educational setting. In 1969 they joined together to form the present-day Kingswood Oxford School.
