Richard M. Bissell was president of The Hartford Fire Insurance Company for twenty-eight years and was described as “tall, distinguished looking, quietly confident, and able” according to a history of the company. However, his son described him as a “somewhat distant figure at home.” The Bissell family purchased the Clemens family home in 1903 for $28,800 and moved in shortly thereafter. Richard’s wife, Marie, was “a midwestener who found Hartford society stuffy,” says historian Eugene R. Gaddis. “Even during Prohibition, champagne flowed liberally at her soirees, and on the morning after at least one party, a grand piano was spotted on her front lawn.” She later became a patron of the legendary director of the Wadsworth Atheneum (link) art museum, A. Everett “Chick” Austin, who in the 1930s brough the likes of Gertrude Stein, Piet Mondrian, and George Balanchine, to Hartford. The Bissell’s raised three children in the home: William, Richard Bissell Jr., and Anne-Caroline. William kept a pet alligator in the Clemenses’ conservatory.

He is viewed as one of the most significant spies in CIA history.
