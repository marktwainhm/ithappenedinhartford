After 45 years of fundraising, 19 years of restoration, and 100 years after its initial construction, the Mark Twain Memorial opened its doors as a museum in September 1974. At that time you entered through the basement of the house where the gift shop and ticket desk were located. The kitchen wing was staff offices, and a number of the unrestored rooms were used as collections storage. In 1974, Wilson Faude was the curator of the museum and oversaw years of research, tedious re-stenciling, and the acquisition of objects and furniture belonging to the Clemens family. In an article about the opening celebrations, Faude is quoted as saying, “about 14 percent of the furnishings belonged to Twain and the family. The rest was donated by citizens after rigid documentation for historical validity.”
