In the 1950s, a new generation took on the rigorous job of restoring the Mark Twain House to its appearance in the Clemensesâ€™ time. Notable among these was Edith Colgate Salsbury. Born in Bedford, New York, she was an artist, and her first love was painting. She spent time studying at the Ecole Americaine des Beaux Arts in France where she eventually met her future husband Charles Baker Salsbury. After graduating from Smith College, she decided to refocus her attention to the field of history and when her family relocated to Hartford she soon became involved in the Mark Twain Memorial. She appeared at the house almost daily, performing nearly every task that needed to be done: drafting plans, raising funds, devising publicity, conducting research, and even whitewashing walls and sweeping floors. In 1965 Salsbury published an engaging account of life in the Clemens household taken from the actual words of family members and others titled, Susy and Mark Twain. She was made a trustee and vice president of the Mark Twain Memorial as well as the Chairman of the Research Committee. In addition to all her work dedicated to the legacy of the Clemens family, Salsbury was also a member of the National Arts Club, the National Society of Women Painters and Sculptors, and the Cosmopolitan Club.
