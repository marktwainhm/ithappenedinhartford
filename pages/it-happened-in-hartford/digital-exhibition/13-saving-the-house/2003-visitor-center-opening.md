By the early-2000s the Mark Twain House’s staff, visitation, and collection had outgrown the two historic buildings (the house itself and the adjacent carriage house). Thus the institution hired architect Robert A.M. Sterns to design and build a museum center. The resulting 35,000-square-foot building was built into the hillside so it wouldn’t overshadow the historic structures, but would provide space for administrative use, retail, education, exhibitions, and collections storage. Then Executive Director John Boyer is quoted as saying “He \[Twain\] is constantly and continually percolating through popular culture. He’s out there. He is being read in the classrooms. He is still being converted into films and television projects and all of that kind of stuff. There are more and more kid’s versions of Twain’s stories. It’s remarkable; there really is a growth market for this legacy”
