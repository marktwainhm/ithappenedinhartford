Formal restoration of the house began in 1963, the same year the Mark Twain House was designated a National Historic Landmark.
The work began with the Billiards Room. Research, physical investigation, and restoration of the rest of the house continued, and all the major rooms of the home were opened in time for the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the house in 1974.

In 1999, the museum began a capital campaign that led to the opening of the museum center in 2003, by which time the organization had been renamed The Mark Twain House & Museum.  The new structure, strategically located and nestled in a hillside not to detract from the Mark Twain House, was designed by Robert A. M. Stern as the first LEED-certified “green” museum in the United States.

The following years included a significant interior restoration in 2004-2005, including the restoration of the Kitchen and Servants’ Wing.
The 2010 Centennial of Mark Twain’s death was an occasion for a revival of activities in the house and museum. During that summer, as average museum attendance declined in the region, attendance at the Mark Twain House & Museum reached record levels.
