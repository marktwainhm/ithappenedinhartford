In the spring of 1883 Daniel T. Molloy, an Irish immigrant living in Hartford, heard that Mark Twain needed a gardener. Not just any gardener, Molloy told an interviewer years later, but one who had worked for “an Earl or a Duke.” Samuel Clemens was probably being playful, but Molloy had in fact worked for the Earl of Portarlington  in Ireland. Molloy knocked on the door of the Farmington Avenue house, but Clemens was in a “creative fever” – before him was a summer of resuming work on Huckleberry Finn, which he had set aside for three years. The Irishman returned in the afternoon. “Are you the man who was here this morning?” Clemens asked. He was, and started to recount his resume. “It doesn’t make any difference about your experience,” Clemens said. “Consider yourself hired.”

“I never worked for a better man,” Molloy said, though he once rebuked his boss for always summoning him with a whistle. Molloy got tired of this and finally refused to reply. “I didn’t hear you call me,” he told Clemens. “I heard you call a dog.”

Molloy’s copy of *Popular Floriculture* by Peter Henderson, a well-known work among gardeners of the era, is in the Museum’s archive today. The book was given to Molloy by Olivia Clemens. We can see notes Molloy made in the margins, particularly in sections about things like getting roses to bloom in the winter in greenhouses or are those that blossom late in the season, as the Clemenses spent their summers in Elmira, New York, and did not go in much for summer blooms in Hartford.

Ill health forced him to resign in October 1885. Upon his resignation, Molloy received as a signed copy of *Uncle Tom’s Cabin* from neighbor Harriet Beecher Stowe. “I used to leave the door of the greenhouse open,” he said, “so she could go in and pick a flower.” Clemens gave him three months’ wages so that he could recuperate in Ireland, his home country, and supplied a hand-written testimonial: 

> *The bearer, Daniel Molloy, has served me two years and seven months and this is to certify (& I do it voluntarily & unasked), that in all that time he has been a model of industry, sobriety & fidelity; has shown a willing disposition; & has neither created, nor allowed himself to be drawn into trouble with the other servants. He could stay with me the rest of his life if the state of his health would enable him to do the work required.* 

> *I am not qualified to speak as to his abilities as a gardener, for I know nothing of such things, but I am quite sure that he can be depended upon to describe his capacities himself without intentionally exaggerating them.* 

Whatever health issue caused him to leave the Clemenses’ employ, it did not prevent Molloy from serving more than 32 years on the Hartford police force. At the time of the 1928 interview there was local controversy about the fate of the Mark Twain House that was to culminate in the building’s preservation a year later. “I hope the poor man hasn’t turned over in his grave at all the contention over buying his house as a memorial to him,” Molloy said. “I feel he deserves some kind of a memorial, for he has certainly brought fame and honor to Hartford.”
