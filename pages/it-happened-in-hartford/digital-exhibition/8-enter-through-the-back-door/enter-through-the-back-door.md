Olivia grew up in a wealthy Elmira family and when she married Samuel, he was expected to meet the same social and economic levels to which she was accustomed.  When they moved to Hartford, the Clemenses joined the Nook Farm neighborhood which came with the social network expected of this upperly-mobile couple. One of the expectations of their upper-middle class lifestyle was to have paid staff to cook and clean, watch the children, and run the house. And with a 25-room house, three growing girls, and all the visitors coming to see “the famous Mark Twain”, they needed to hire a lot of people to keep things running. At any given moment, the family would have employed between 7 and 11 people at a time. Between 1874 and 1891, the house and carriage house were home, work, or both to more than 30 different people. We don’t know the names and stories for all of those thirty people as not all of them are recorded in documents such as letters or census records, but we do know a little bit about a few of them and are constantly attempting to discover more.
