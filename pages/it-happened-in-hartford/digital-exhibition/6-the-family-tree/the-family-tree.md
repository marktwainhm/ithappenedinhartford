Of course, the family was much larger than the six Clemenses â€“ Samuel, Olivia, Langdon, Susy, Clara, and Jean. Clara Clemens was the only child to survive her parents, Samuel and Olivia. She married twice and had one daughter, Nina, who died childless. There are no direct descendents of Samuel and Olivia Clemens today. 

But the family tree does have branches through aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, and cousins. Some of the notable extended family members are listed below. Click on their photo to learn more about them.
