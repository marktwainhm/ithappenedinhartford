The American Publishing Company , once located at 284 Asylum Street, was founded in Hartford on April 10, 1865, at the very end of the Civil War, in fact only one day after Lee surrendered to Grant. 

The company was established as a subscription-based publishing house, which meant that salesmen sold books door to door using a “salesmen’s prospectus;” a thin, condensed version of the actual book with sample chapters, illustrations, and bindings. After the salesmen presented a customer with the prospectus and made their pitch, they could read a chapter or two, ponder over the drawings, and ultimately decide if they wanted to place an order. If so, they were able to choose which binding and cover they wanted which ranged in price. 

For  _Adventures of Huckleberry Finn_ you could get the cheapest green cloth cover for $2.75 or the most expensive half Morocco with marbled edges for $4.25. (As an aside the average daily wage was $2.00). This method of sales allowed publishing companies to reach more people who did not necessarily have a bookstore nearby to purchase from. 

Once the American Publishing Company designated itself subscription sales only, they got to work putting out three books in the first two years (one of which was the Bible). In 1867, Elisha Bliss joined the company and quickly transformed it into a busy, high functioning endeavor. He embraced new emerging genres along with ones normally ignored by subscription publishers like humor. That led him to invite Mark Twain to write a humorous book about his travels aboard the Quaker City excursion, a 5–6-month journey to Europe and the Holy Lands where Twain detailed sights, sounds, food, people to give a taste back home to Americans who could not afford to make it to these exotic locales. The result was _Innocents Abroad_, Twain’s best-selling book during his lifetime. 

This publication kicked off steady growth for the publishing company which continued through the mid 1880’s. According to scholar R. Kent Rasmussen, “During its first two decades, the company published about 80 books – a huge number for a subscription publisher – by writers including Josh Billings, Bret Harte, Charles Dudley Warner, and Dan De Quille.” Additionally, the company published all of Mark Twain’s major works through 1880: _Roughing It_ (1872), _The Gilded Age_ (1873), _Sketches, New and Old_ (1875), _The Adventures of Tom Sawyer_ (1876), and _A Tramp Abroad_ (1880). Altogether over 300,000 were sold and Mark Twain’s books were the company’s main feature. 

Twain eventually left American Publishing to form his own publishing house called Charles L. Webster & Co, named for Clemens’ niece’s husband. which published _Adventures of Huckleberry Finn_ and General Grant’s famous memoirs among others before shutting down in 1894. By creating his own publishing house Clemens earned dual income as author and publisher, taking advantage of multiple revenue streams. 

Twain also accused the American Publishing Company of cheating him out of thousands of dollars from inaccurate book sale reports, and Clemens’ brother Orion convinced him Bliss was dishonest.  Despite this accusation and the tense relationship that followed, Twain returned to American Publishing to put out _Puddn’head Wilson_ (1894) and _Following the Equator_ (1897). At this point in time, the subscription market was failing, and they were holding on mainly due to selling uniform editions of Mark Twain’s back titles. In 1903, the company was finally sold to Harper’s. 

The success of his first book, _The Innocents Abroad_, is one reason the Clemens came to Hartford —  to be closer to the publisher, be a part of the growing publishing industry in the city, build ties with the business, and keep an eye on the publisher. Clemens ambitions were to get his work into the homes of as many people as possible. Subscription publication ensured that it was cheaper and easier to anyone to read…Clemens once commented, “Anything but subscription publication is printing for private circulation.” Mark Twain’s books were heavily marketed by using this form of sales and publishing.  Salesmen were sent to small towns all over the country to promote and pitch his newest title.

The process from writing a book to getting it published isn’t always a direct line with editors, illustrators, the typesetters, printers, and binders all wanting to get their say in. However, before any of those people got their hands on Clemens’ narratives, his wife Olivia acted as his first editor. Olivia would read through his pages and strike out anything she thought unfit for print. It became a bit of a game between the two, with Clemens adding prose for the pure enjoyment of Olivia’s reaction and inevitable strike out.
