In 1878 at 79 Asylum Street Brown & Gross Booksellers and Stationers were next door neighbors to clothiers Covey & Smith, later Smith, White & Co. Brown & Gross moved its location around the city several times and additionally went through several name changes throughout its long history.

It started in 1835 and lasted until 1993 when it closed down permanently under the name of Huntington’s. In 1846 the partners and owners at the time, Brown and Parsons, moved their business in 1846 to the corner of Main and Asylum streets. Parsons left the business only a few years later in 1852, while Flavius Brown remained at the helm. He was joined by William Gross in 1858, forming Brown & Gross. According to scholar Dan Sterner, at this location on March 6, 1860, Abraham Lincoln, an avid reader, visited the store after making a speech the night before in the city. While visiting the bookstore he met with Connecticut Republican Gideon Welles, who would later become the Secretary of the Navy in Lincoln’s administration.

In 1869 the store moved to 77-79 Asylum Street and is the location where Mark Twain would often visit. He spent time entertaining Brown & Gross in the backroom telling various stories or humorous tales not meant for polite society. In fact, one customer called them, “unsuitable for Sunday school.”

Flavius Brown was also the treasurer for the city of Hartford and worked from his office located in the back of the bookstore. Brown’s attention was diverted from focusing on the book industry and led to William Gross being responsible for the day-to-day operations and management of the company. Despite Brown’s death in 1880, and Gross taking on a new partner, Leverett Belknap, they decided to keep the name unchanged. It remained so until Gross’s death in 1891 when it no longer would go by its now decades old moniker and was renamed Belknap and Warfield to reflect the new ownership. Belknap first began his career at Brown & Gross in 1864 at just thirteen years old.

Throughout its time in Hartford, it was considered the place to go to purchase books and stationery. It was often visited by local luminaries of the time including Harriet Beecher Stowe, Charles Dudley Warner, Horace Bushnell, Lydia Sigourney, Joseph Twichell, William Gillette, and of course Mark Twain.
