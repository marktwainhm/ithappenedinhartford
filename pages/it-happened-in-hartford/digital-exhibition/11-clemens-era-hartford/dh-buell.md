A section of Hartford, known as Statehouse Square, was a center of commerce with stores and business offices of all kinds focused around the then/former center of government. Dwight H. Buell's Jewelry shop which, according to the 1881 Geer's Hartford City Directory was located on 54 High Street, was one such business. 

Dwight H. Buell was a jeweler, silversmith, and watchmaker in the city of Hartford who ended up with a role in the financial calamity that forced the Clemens family to leave the city permanently. Buell was the go-to for any jewelry needs whether that be necklaces, watches, rings, clocks, cufflinks, etc. and dabbled in investments as well. The Clemens family purchased from his shop often, and their receipts over the years include items like combs, clocks, mounting for mosaic pin, and eyeglass repairs. In his autobiography in 1890 Clemens reminisced about his friendship with Buell and how it led to one of the biggest mistakes of his lifetime:

_Ten or eleven years ago, Dwight Buell, a jeweler, called at our house and was shown up to the billiard room --- which was my study; and the game got more study than the other sciences. He wanted me to take some stock in a type-setting machine. He said it was at the Colt Arms factory, and was about finished. I took $2,000 of the stock. I was always taking little chances like that; and almost always losing by it too – a thing which I did not greatly mind, because I was always careful to risk only such amounts as I could easily afford to lose._

The Paige Compositor was the name of the aforementioned type-setting machine and Clemens believed in it and put his money behind it. It required over 18,000 moveable parts and never worked properly. He became frustrated with the inventor, James Paige, and snarked, “What a talker he is. He could persuade a fish to come out and take a walk with him. When he is present I always believe him – I cannot help it. When he is gone away all the belief evaporates. He is a most daring and majestic liar.” Instead of revolutionizing the printing industry it failed miserably and cost Clemens not only tons of money, but the safety, security, and happiness of the life they had built together in Hartford.  

One jewelry purchase made by the Clemenses from Buell’s shop were a pair of topaz cufflinks which are in the Museum’s collections today, still in their original hinged box with Buell's business stamped into the lining of the box top. We believe topaz was selected as it is the birthstone of November and both Clemens and his wife Olivia have birthdays in that month. 

These cufflinks with their large and dare we say gaudy topaz jewels are a symbol of both Clemens’ prosperity as well as his financial decline. Now whether these jewels were purchased through Olivia’s family wealth or due to Clemens’ success as a writer, publisher, and lecturer (or from any of this other side hustles), we do not know. But to be able to afford such a luxury item and then the privilege of wearing them about town nods to at least a time of financial stability for the family. However, Dwight Buell was associated with James Paige and was one person who encouraged Clemens to invest in Paige's typesetting machine, which ultimately contributed to financial ruin for the Clemenses. Which leads one to wonder how much of a gilded façade were these cufflinks to Clemens’ true financial stability?

Buell died in 1889 at the age of 55; just a couple of years before the Clemens family had to move out of their beloved home due to the failure of the Paige Compositor and a devastating loss of money.
