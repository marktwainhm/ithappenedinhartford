If you were to go to 203 Trumbull street in downtown Hartford today you would see a TD Bank location, but back when the Clemenses lived in Hartford, this site at the corner of Trumbull and Asylum was home to the [Allyn House](https://emuseum.chs.org/emuseum/objects/25832/allyn-house-corner-of-asylum-street-and-trumbull-street-ha), one of Hartford’s premier hotels. The imposing four-story hotel had two five-story towers and a 400-seat dining hall that ran the entire length of its west side. ) 

On the one hand the Allyn House was a stop on many of Clemens’ tour schedules as he lectured and promoted his persona of Mark Twain. Despite being a well-known author, Clemens didn’t make enough from selling his books to fully  make ends meet, so speaking on a range of topics from race, class, gender, and politics to his own writings, lecturing played a key role in keeping Clemens and his family financially stable. Twain was in good company lecturing at the Allyn House which was popular with famous visitors to Hartford including President Lincoln in March 1860 and Frederick Douglass in 1864 and 1883.  

During this time period, leisure travel was on the rise. The very idea of taking time to rest was being debated with class, gender, and race all finding their conflicts on who was allowed or expected to take part in leisure activities and travel and when. The Allyn House, along with being a hotel, had a restaurant, a drugstore, a theater hall, and a soda shop that offered “Specialty of Fancy Egg Drinks.” The Allyn House is a prime example of the duality of sustaining Samuel Clemens while creating Mark Twain. CLemens was becoming a part of the society who would stay at the Allyn House while traveling for leisure or at least attend a lecture or dinner party there. But he also was the one performing on stage. While he vehemently denied being an actor, there is no doubt that Clemens was a performer and Mark Twain was his well crafted character. Scholars use Mark Twain as the connection between vaudeville performances of the 1800s and the rise in humorous lectures in the 1900s, arguing that Mark Twain was the first stand-up comedian. Clemens, as Twain, was at the forefront of having a career as a creative, sustaining a celebrity persona, and what today we refer to as “side-hustle culture” when that creative career doesn’t quite meet our basic needs and wants. 

The Allyn House was also where we first meet George Griffin who worked as a waiter at the Allyn House prior to becoming the Clemens’ butler. While Clemens recalled Griffin came one day “to wash some windows and remained half a generation,” it is more likely that the two crossed paths in Hartford, possibly at the Allyn House, and Griffin was recommended for the position of butler. With the ever financially precarious reality of being a working creative, Samuel Clemens had to create and maintain an upper-middle class lifestyle afforded to him by his wife’s social circle and his celebrity image. This lifestyle built the House we celebrate today, but also meant having servants at home, including a butler, like Griffin, cooks, maids, and a coachman.

Griffin on the other hand, as a formerly enslaved person living in the era of reconstruction, embodied side-hustle culture as dictated by the racism of the time. Griffin's “main job” was always “in service” of others, mostly middle to upper class white people, and those jobs did not always pay a living wage. While in Hartford Griffin, thanks to his personality, wits, and skills, was able to create a bookmaker business on the side to help support himself and his family.
