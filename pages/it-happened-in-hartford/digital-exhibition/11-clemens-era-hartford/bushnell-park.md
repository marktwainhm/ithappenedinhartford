Bushnell Park is the main greenspace in downtown Hartford, and was the first publicly funded public park in the United States. In the 1850s Hartford was a booming town that brought people here to work in a variety of industries including publishing, insurance, banking, munitions, and manufacturing. And, during this period of rapid industrialization, a movement began to bring curated pockets of nature into cities, like Central Park in New York City, to combat the pollution, poor water quality, overcrowding, and other urban issues. 

When Hartford decided to add their own park, they did contact Frederick Law Olmstead, a Hartford Native and friend of Dr. Horace Bushnell, who was pushing for the parkâ€™s creation. Unfortunately, Olmstead was busy designing Central Park, but recommended Swiss-born landscape architect and botanist Jacob Wedinman for the job. 

Wedinman was hired and created a plan in 1861 that had a distinctive natural style, which featured smoothly sculpted contours and graceful paths leading to focal points like the meandering Park River. The plan included informal clusters of evergreen and deciduous trees, which screened the sites and sounds of the city, a departure from the formal New England town center green.

As part of the plan, Weidenmann selected 157 varieties of Trees and shrubs from North America, Europe and Eastern Asia to grace the park. A total of 1,100 individual specimens were planted, creating a canopy of green covering the Park. Over the years, many important architectural features, such as the Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Arch (1886), the Capitol (1876), Corning Fountain (1899), the Carousel (1974) and the Performance Pavilion (1995) were added, while other scenic elements, such as the Park River and its several graceful bridges, were demolished in the 1940s.

Both when it was created in the 1850s and now, Bushnell Park acts as the main greenspace in downtown Hartford. Bushnell Park serves as a place to gather, celebrate, and relax. Whether it is attending a festival, circus, or lecture, or merely taking a walk or having a picnic, Bushnell Park is a prime location. But this begs the question, who gets to partake in these kinds of leisure activities?
