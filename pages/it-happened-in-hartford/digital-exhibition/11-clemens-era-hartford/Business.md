We think of “Clemens Era Hartford” as the seventeen years the Clemens family lived here. But we have to remember that Hartford’s existing sophisticated population, dynamic commerce, splendid homes, broad avenues, and natural beauty were what attracted Samuel and Olivia Clemens to relocate here in 1871. And Hartford continued to grow and thrive after the Clemenses left.
