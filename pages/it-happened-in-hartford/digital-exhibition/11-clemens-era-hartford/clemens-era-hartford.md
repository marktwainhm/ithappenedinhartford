We think of “Clemens Era Hartford” as the seventeen years the Clemens family lived here. But we have to remember that Hartford’s existing sophisticated population, dynamic commerce, splendid homes, broad avenues, and natural beauty were what attracted Samuel and Olivia Clemens to relocate here in 1871. And Hartford continued to grow and thrive after the Clemenses left. 

The family came to Hartford with some financial stability brought by Olivia’s inherited wealth, but they needed to find sustained economic and social success to raise their family and  grow Samuel’s career in writing and lecturing as Mark Twain. The business of being Mark Twain was just taking off with the success of his first book, Innocents Abroad, published in 1869 by Hartford’s own American Publishing Company. Moving to Hartford meant being close to its booming publishing business for Clemens’ writing, as well as the “correct” social circles who might attend his lecture tours and connect him to other business opportunities, allowing Samuel to earn a little extra on the side. 

Just think… 

> Just 8 years before they came to Hartford, Samuel had been roaming around the west trying to land a job that would give him money and a place in society, writing for newspapers, and prospecting (unsuccessfully) for silver.

> Just 6 years before, Samuel was struggling to make ends meet to such a degree that he quipped to his brother, “If I do not get out of debt in three months — pistols or poison for one — exit me.”

> Just 4 years before, Samuel was working as a reporter and boarded a ship headed to the Holy Land. His writings from this journey would turn into his first published book that earned him his first real money.

> Just 2 years before, Samuel moved up the social ladder by marrying a wealthy progressive daughter of a lumber and coal magnet from Elmira, New York

Now, with some money in the bank, some financial stability brought by his wife’s wealth, Samuel was ready to use his creative drive and hustle mentality to make a place for himself and his family in this city.
