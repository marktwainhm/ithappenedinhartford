We think of “Clemens Era Hartford” as the seventeen years the Clemens family lived here. But we have to remember that  Hartford’s growing sophisticated population, dynamic commerce, splendid homes, broad avenues, and natural beauty were already in full swing and were what attracted Samuel and Olivian Clemens to relocate here in 1871. And Hartford continued to grow and thrive after the Clemenses left. 

They came with some financial stability brought by Olivia’s inherited wealth, but they needed to find sustained economic and social stability to raise their growing family and to grow Samuel’s career in writing and lecturing as Mark Twain, a business that was just taking off with the success of his first book, _Innocents Abroad_. Hartford had a booming publishing business for his writing, the “correct” social circles that would come to and solicit his lecture tour, and enough other business opportunities that Samuel could dabble in to earn a little extra on the side. 

Just think… 

Just 8 years before Samuel had been roaming around the west trying to land on a job that would give him money and a place in society, writing to 

Just 6 years before, Samuel was struggling so that he quipped to his brother, “If I do not get out of debt in three months — pistols or poison for one — exit me.”

Just 4 years before, Samuel was working as a reporter and boarded a ship headed to the Holy Land. His writings from this journey would turn into his first published book that got him his first real money.

Just 2 years before Samuel moved up the social ladder by marrying a wealthy progressive daughter of a lumber and coal magnet from Elmira, New York

Now, with some money in the bank, some financial stability brought by his wife’s wealth, Samuel was ready to use his creative drive and hustle mentality to make a place for himself and his family in this city.
