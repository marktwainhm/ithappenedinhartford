In 1819 a group of African Americans living in Hartford were tired of having to sit in the back of churches and given assigned seating in galleries. They decided they would worship on their own terms and started in a small conference room of the First Church of Christ, now Center Church. They became the first Black Congregational Church in the state and the third oldest in the country. A year later they moved to a building on State Street and formed “The African American Religious Society of Hartford.” Plans began to find a new house of worship where all were welcomed, and seating was wherever one chose. Eventually they purchased a property at the corner of Talcott and Market streets and built a stone and brick church. It was the epicenter for Hartford’s Black community and a meeting place for abolitionists and the social movements that emerged during the period. Additionally, the church realized they needed to educate their members in order to help them succeed and therefore established a school district where Black children could learn how to read and write; the only place they could do so for many years.

One of its most prominent early pastors was a man named Dr. James W.C. Pennington, a former fugitive enslaved man who escaped from Maryland via the Underground Railroad. The fear of being returned to enslavement stayed with him for years until Harriet Beecher Stowe’s brother-in-law, John Hooker, procured his freedom for $150. He received his freedom papers on June 3, 1851. His Bible remains at the church today.

Mark Twain gave a reading at Hartford’s Unity Hall on May 22, 1889, as a fundraiser and benefit for the Talcott Street Church who were trying to raise money for a new organ. His performance and readings included, “[On the Decay of the Art of Lying,](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2572/pg2572-images.html)” and “[How I Escaped Being Killed in a Duel](https://www.loa.org/news-and-views/1896-mark-twain-8220how-i-escaped-being-killed-in-a-duel8221/),” among others.  

By 1860 the church was renamed the Talcott Street Congregational Church and remained so until 1953 when it joined the congregation from Mother Bethel Methodist to form Faith Congregational Church, the name it goes by still.
