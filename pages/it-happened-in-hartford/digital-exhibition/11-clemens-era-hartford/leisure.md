  <p>Both when it was created in the 1850s and now, Bushnell Park acts as the main greenspace in downtown Hartford. The park was originally designed by Swiss-born landscape architect Jacob Weidmann. His plan was to embrace nature with graceful paths leading to scenic views along the meandering Park River. Over the years the park has changed and been redesigned, with the most notable construction being the burial of the park River between 1940 and 1980. </p>
  <p>In Clemens time as well as today, Bushnell Park serves as a place to gather, celebrate, and relax. Whether it is attending a festival, circus, or lecture, or merely taking a walk or having a picnic, Bushnell Park is a prime location. But this begs the question, who gets to partake in these kinds of leisure activities?</p>
  <p>In the Clemens’s era classism, racism, social-economics, and gender expectations dictated every aspect of life, including leisure activities – from who was allowed to go where and with whom to what the proper attire was during those leisure activities. We like to think we’ve come a long way since the 1870s, but similar restrictions still remain today as we as a society continue the battle for human rights and their impacts on our lives. </p>

  <p>Bicycling was another favorite summer pastime for both men and women in the Victorian age. According to scholar Dr. Charlotte James: “Bicycles were used for leisure by the upper classes and were a convenient form of transport for the middle and lower classes. However, bicycles came to mean much more for many women and were crucial in them gaining a level of independence. Bicycles allowed women to escape the prying eyes of their household and provided them with an opportunity to exercise. Suddenly, women were able to travel where they wanted when they wanted, giving them a new feeling of self-reliance and freedom.” </p>
  <p>In May 1884 Clemens tried to learn how to ride a bicycle with his Hartford friend, Rev. Joseph Twichell. “Twichell & I have been breaking our necks & bones all the past 7 days trying to learn to ride the bicycle,” he wrote to a friend—“but we have acquired the art, now, & shan’t break anything more.”  </p>
  <p>Clemens was fascinated by technology and inventions and the bicycle was no exception in an era when all kinds of health benefits were ascribed to its use. His bicycle had been built by a company established in Hartford by Albert Pope, a Civil War veteran and bicycle visionary. He wondered “whether Twichell & I will beat the bicycle, or whether the bicycle will beat us.” </p>
  <p> _We have fought the creature a couple of weeks, now, & we have honorable wounds to show for it. This morning we traveled a couple of miles, mainly up hill, —& made it derned uncomfortable for the wagons; for they could never tell just which way we were proposing to steer—& neither could we._ </p>
  <p>Inspired by his failed attempts, Clemens penned the story “Taming the Bicycle.”  </p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Baseball</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Baseball is considered the national sport of the United States. Fans cheer on their favorite teams with opening day marking the beginning of summer and the World Series championship concluding the season. The Baseball Hall of Fame says: “the first professional baseball games were played in the wake of” the American Civil War and by the 1840s “baseball mania” was in full swing. They go on to say that “from the Civil War to Civil Rights and all points in between and beyond, the game of baseball supports and reflects many aspects of American life, from culture to economics and technological advances. It inspires movements, instills pride and even heals cities.” </p>
   <p>On May 18, 1875, Clemens and his friend Rev. Joseph Twichell took in a baseball game in Hartford—The Hartford Dark Blues versus the Boston Red Stockings. Over the course of the game (which Boston won) Clemens’s brown umbrella went missing, prompting the following newspaper advertisement:   _TWO HUNDRED AND FIVE DOLLARS REWARD – At the great baseball match on Tuesday, while I was engaged in hurrahing, a small boy walked off with an English-made brown silk UMBRELLA belonging to me, and forgot to bring it back. I will pay $5 for the return of that umbrella in good condition to my house on Farmington Avenue. I do not want the boy (in an active state) but will pay two hundred dollars for his remains. SAMUEL L. CLEMENS_ </p>
    <p>Several years later, during a summer stay in Elmira, New York, Clemens went from spectator to participant. He agreed to serve as umpire for the local baseball game as long as he was provided with a chair, fan, umbrella, and a pitcher of ice water. He was to be joined in his duties by friend and fellow umpire, Thomas Beecher, reverend of the Park Church. But Clemens changed his mind, a newspaper reported, saying “he could not make a martyr of himself, notwithstanding the fact that he would be glad to perish in a good cause.” He “used a big fan in a vigorous manner and said that he would encourage the players with his presence, but he must refuse to go out in the sun.” </p>
     <p>Despite his lack of cooperation in that game Clemens vigorously exclaimed, “Baseball...is the very symbol, the outward and visible expression of the drive, and push, and rush and struggle of the raging, tearing, booming nineteenth century!”  Clemens’s appreciation of the sport continued throughout the years, even attending games during his visit to Bermuda in 1908, a couple of years before his death. </p>
