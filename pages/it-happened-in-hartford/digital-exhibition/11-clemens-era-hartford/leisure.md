Social Clubs were a source of entertainment and status during the Gilded Age. The Clemenses were patrons and participants in many social clubs and engangments. Below are three often associated with the Clemenses.

  <p>Bicycling was a favorite summer pastime for both men and women in the Victorian age. According to scholar Dr. Charlotte James: “Bicycles were used for leisure by the upper classes and were a convenient form of transport for the middle and lower classes. However, bicycles came to mean much more for many women and were crucial in them gaining a level of independence. Bicycles allowed women to escape the prying eyes of their household and provided them with an opportunity to exercise. Suddenly, women were able to travel where they wanted when they wanted, giving them a new feeling of self-reliance and freedom.” 
 
In May 1884 Clemens tried to learn how to ride a bicycle with his Hartford friend, Rev. Joseph Twichell. “Twichell & I have been breaking our necks & bones all the past 7 days trying to learn to ride the bicycle,” he wrote to a friend—“but we have acquired the art, now, & shan’t break anything more.”  
 
Clemens was fascinated by technology and inventions and the bicycle was no exception in an era when all kinds of health benefits were ascribed to its use. His bicycle had been built by a company established in Hartford by Albert Pope, a Civil War veteran and bicycle visionary. He wondered “whether Twichell & I will beat the bicycle, or whether the bicycle will beat us.” 
 We have fought the creature a couple of weeks, now, & we have honorable wounds to show for it. This morning we traveled a couple of miles, mainly up hill, —& made it derned uncomfortable for the wagons; for they could never tell just which way we were proposing to steer—& neither could we. 
Inspired by his failed attempts, Clemens penned the story “Taming the Bicycle.”

  <p>In October 1876 Samuel and Olivia helped form and organize a Hartford discussion group for 20 to 25 girls in their late teens. They would meet every Saturday morning to read and discuss topical essays and debate the content. Samuel put together the rules of the group and would participate himself by leading discussions and occasionally reading his own works aloud to them; he was the only male. 
Special guests were a common occurrence and included local college professors as well as authors such as William Dean Howells, Bret Harte, and Charles Dudley Warner. A few years after the club was formed Clemens ordered pins from Tiffany & Co. to give as a gift to the members. After the Clemens family had to move out of their beloved Hartford home due to poor finances in 1891, the group continued to meet. In 1878, Olivia wrote a letter to its members before departing on a long overseas trip begging them that, “…you will keep the Club compact & strong, & neither suffer it to languish nor die – for it is worthy to outlive us all…” In fact, the Saturday Morning Club is still active to this day and gather together on appointed dates to read their work and discuss it with one another.</p>

  <p>The Monday Evening Club was formed in 1869 and meant to be a discussion group for local distinguished Hartford men with a cap of twenty members. Its membership included such names as Dr. Horace Bushnell, Calvin Stowe, J.H. Trumbull, Rev. Joseph Twichell, Charles Dudley Warner, and others. The members of the group rotated hosting duties where they discussed papers read by their fellow participants.  Clemens was voted into the group in 1873 and presented his first paper titled, “License of the Press” shortly thereafter. He remained an active part of the group until 1890, a year before the family had to leave Hartford due to financial difficulties. Some of Clemens’ presented papers included, “Universal Suffrage,” "The Facts Concerning the Recent Carnival of Crime in Connecticut,” and “On the Decay of the Art of Lying.” Clemens once wrote to William Dean Howells noting, “We always have a rattling good time at the Club.” </p>
