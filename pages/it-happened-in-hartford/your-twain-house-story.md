The Mark Twain House & Museum welcomes over 55,000 people annually, and countless people experienced the House in the 100 years prior to its opening as a museum.

This is the chance for our community at large to share how this house has impacted your life, in its many uses from a single-family dwelling, a school,  apartments, and a library branch, before opening as a historic house museum. We want to hear your memories, capture them for our institutional archive and create a community of mutual pride for this place.
- Do you remember seeing Richard Bissel, Jr. 's pet alligator in the conservatory?
- Did your relative attend school here? 
- What was your favorite book that you checked out from the library branch when it was here? 
- Were you a part of the House’s restoration? 
No matter what it is, we want to know YOUR Twain House story!
