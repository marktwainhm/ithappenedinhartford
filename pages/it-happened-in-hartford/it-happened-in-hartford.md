In the years after the American Civil War, at the dawn of the information age, as publishing and performing were beginning to revolutionize how people produced and consumed news, ideas, history and images, Samuel Clemens saw the possibility of making a living by writing books that dealt with the important issues of the day, for everyone to read, and sought financial and social stability through this work. And Clemens didn’t just write books; he created the character of Mark Twain, a voice meant to represent a distinctly American point of view telling stories about Americans living in a rapidly changing world. In so doing, Clemens helped establish the information economy, celebrity culture, and something else (obviously wordsmithing to be done…just trying to get some thoughts down). 
The exhibition will examine the early years of the creative economy, information economy, building new audiences and means of content delivery, it's about storytelling, and hidden voices, it's about the invention of the canon and sole creative author as master of their content, all told through the story of Samuel Clemens and Mark Twain, and time they spent in Hartford.

*It Happened In Hartford: 150 years of the Mark Twain House* is an exhibition that explores the lives of Samuel Clemens (better known as the creator of Mark Twain) and his wife Olivia and three daughters during the time they lived in Hartford, fresh on the success of his first book Innocents Abroad, and as Samuel built his career and wrote the works that he is most known for–Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. By coming to Hartford, the Clemens family was looking for stability, to grow Samuel’s career and climb the social ladder…and they found all and more for some time in Hartford. This exhibit will  focus on the house they built, the community they joined, the people who worked here, and the City of Hartford itself through the lens of Samuel Clemens’ career. 

Making a living as a creative–a writer and a performer–was a fairly new thing in the late 19th century, and most who did so had family money to rely on as they spent their days in creative pursuits. Samuel Clemens did not have this luxury, not coming from wealth himself and having spent much of his earnings from Innocents Abroad, as well as his wife’s inheritance on constructing their Hartford home. Instead, Clemens became an innovator in brand management and side hustle culture, building the business that was Mark Twain, while juggling multiple side hustles in pursuit of economic stability. 

The Clemenses would spend 17 years in Hartford. Near the end of his life, looking back to the time before the death of his beloved wife and eldest daughter (maybe also Jean?) Samuel Clemens wrote (in what?) that these years were the happiest of their lives. That  statement   steeped in loss and sorrow, cannot do justice to the complex reality of their lives in this house. The family’s time in Hartford  came with  great highs and lows, both personally and professionally. In Hartford they found community in Nook Farm, strength in their family unit, and, for Samuel, success in building the brand of “Mark Twain,” all giving the family a stability they would seek to recreate for the rest of their lives. Ultimately, however, financial hardship and family loss caused the family to leave Hartford, not return, and sell their home here. 

The exhibition consists of display cases located in the Mark Twain House’s Museum Center highlighting objects from our collection, this digital exhibition, and ## history markers around the City of Hartford; and all contribute to our understanding of this place and the people for whom we are tasked to remember.
