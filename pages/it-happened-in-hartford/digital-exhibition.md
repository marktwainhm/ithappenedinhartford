*It Happened In Hartford: 150 years of the Mark Twain House* is an exhibition that explores the lives of Samuel Clemens (better known as the creator of Mark Twain) and his wife Olivia and three daughters during the time they lived in Hartford, fresh on the success of his first book Innocents Abroad, and as Samuel built his career and wrote the works that he is most known for–Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. By coming to Hartford, the Clemens family was looking for stability, to grow Samuel’s career and climb the social ladder…and they found all and more for some time in Hartford. This exhibit will  focus on the house they built, the community they joined, the people who worked here, and the City of Hartford itself through the lens of Samuel Clemens’ career. 

Within this digital exhibition element, you’ll learn more about this famous author, his extraordinary wife; three lively and intelligent daughters; the people who kept their lives going and the place swept, the grounds tended, and the meals coming. You will also find the stories of those who came to live and work in this house after the Clemenses left, particularly those who preserved it from demolition, restored it to its 19th-century glory, and made it into the historic house museum you can visit today. 

This digital exhibition is a wealth of information that you can read on its own, but it also makes a great companion for anyone wanting to take a deeper dive into a topic they found interesting when visiting our historic house museum or from along our history trail in downtown Hartford.
