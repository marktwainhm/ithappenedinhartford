_**It Happened in Hartford: 150 years of the Mark Twain House**_ is a multi-layered exhibition experience that includes this digital exhibition which contains a wealth of information that you can read on its own, or use to take a deeper dive into a topic you found interesting when visiting our historic house museum or our history trail in downtown Hartford.

Within this digital exhibition, you’ll learn more about Samuel Clemens (better known as the creator of Mark Twain), his extraordinary wife, three lively and intelligent daughters, as well as the people who worked at this house, kept the Clemenses’ lives going, and the house clean, the grounds tended, and the meals coming. You will also find the stories of those who came to live and work in this house after the Clemenses left, particularly those who preserved it from demolition, restored it to its 19th-century glory, and made it into the historic house museum you can visit today. 

Use the forward and back arrows on the side of each page to navigate through the exhibtion pages. There are also related pages at the bottom of each exhibiton page and a "Jump To" feature at the top if you'd like to skip to a particular topic.
